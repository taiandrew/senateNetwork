Disregards State errors resulting from recent changes in Federal AFDC eligibility criteria or administrative policies. <p>Permits a State to base a request for the waiver of this Act's sanctions upon a showing that it has made a good faith effort to reduce or eliminate overpayments or underpayments, or that the Secretary incorrectly calculated its overpayment or underpayment error rate. Directs the Secretary to grant such a waiver to a State which expends additional State or local funds, equal to or exceeding one-half of the sanctions which would otherwise be applied against such State, to reduce overpayments or underpayments. <p>Defines ""overpayments"" as (1) payments to ineligible families; and (2) overpayments to eligible families.  Defines ""underpayments"" as underpayments to eligible families. <p>Makes the preceding quality control standards and procedures effective with respect to FY 1986 and thereafter.  Eliminates the backlog of overpayment sanctions applicable to FY 1981 through 1985 by imposing such sanctions only against those States, in each such fiscal year, whose error rates are significantly outside the distribution of such rates among States. <p>Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees, three years after this Act's enactment, regarding the appropriateness of the error rate tolerance levels established pursuant to this Act. <p>Sets State underpayment error rate tolerance levels, applicable beginning in FY 1989, considering the same factors used in determining overpayment tolerance levels.  Requires that States set aside an amount equal to the amount by which its underpayments exceed its underpayment tolerance level and use such amount to increase AFDC payments or improve the administration of the AFDC program. <p>Provides an incentive payment to States whose overpayment error rate is below three percent.  Sets incentive payments at one-half of the reduction in Federal payments attributable to error rates being below three percent. <p>Includes terminations and denials of AFDC eligiblity in this Act's data collection and quality control review requirements.  Directs the Secretary to develop and report to the Congress, within two years of this Act's enactment, on an improved methodology for measuring a State's performance with respect to inappropriate denials and terminations of AFDC eligibility.  Includes, beginning on the first calendar quarter beginning one year or more after this Act's enactment, erroneous denials or terminations of AFDC eligibility within the definition of ""underpayments"" to which error rate tolerance levels apply.",,,,,,

Increases civil and criminal violations and penalties under the Act. <p>Defines a Professional Engineer-Architect (E-A) as an individual who:  (1) has attained, through engineering education and science, a thorough knowledge of mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences and principles and methods of engineering analysis and design; and (2) is registered, where permitted, as a professional engineer in the State where such work is to be performed. <p>Defines serious injury as one requiring professional medical treatment. <p>Defines hazard analysis as a report:  (1) detailing the potential safety hazards (including structural collapses, cave-ins, fires, flooding or other water hazards, explosions, and lightning) that could occur on a construction site throughout the construction process; and (2) containing instructions and provisions for the prevention or handling of potential safety hazards. <p>Sets forth incident reporting, recordkeeping, and investigation procedures relating to construction site accidents. <p>Requires the E-A responsible for the worksite to: (1) immediately investigate any incident upon its occurrence; and (2) report all reportable incidents on the construction worksite to the appropriate regional office of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) by telephone or telegraph immediately after their occurrence. <p>Defines the term ""reportable incident"" as one that:  (1) causes serious injury or death; (2) could have caused serious injury or death, as determined by the E-A; (3) involves a structural failure that leads to a collapse of a building; or (4) involves a near-collapse of a building.  Excludes from such term an incident that causes serious injury or death, if an E-A determines that the incident was not a violation of:  (1) the project construction process and hazard analysis or the Project Safety and Health Program and Procedures; or (2) the Act or a standard promulgated pursuant to the Act. <p>Sets forth the types of information which such report must specify. <p>Requires the employer, appropriate contractor, or the owner to bar ingress to and egress from, or other interference with, an incident site until OSHA completed its investigation, on the occurrence of a reportable incident involving:  (1) three or more serious injuries; (2) a fatality; (3) a life-threatening injury; (4) a structural failure that leads to the collapse of a building; or (5) the near-collapse of a building.  Allows necessary medical treatment or medical transportation and rescue and recovery work to take place at such site.  Prohibits any work from being done at such site until OSHA completes its investigation and certifies that it is safe for work to continue.  Requires the employer, appropriate contractor, or owner to take appropriate measures, as defined by regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary), to prevent the destruction of relevant evidence. <p>Directs OSHA to conduct an investigation of such an incident (including site inspection) as soon as practicable after it is reported.  Requires the employer, appropriate contractor, or owner to grant OSHA immediate access to the incident site. Requires OSHA to ensure a full investigation. Requires such investigation to take place within 24 hours following receipt of the report unless rescue and recovery operations are in progress or OSHA determines that conditions at the site would make investigation dangerous.  Directs OSHA to determine during the investigation whether the incident site is an imminent danger or to certify that work may resume at the site. Directs OSHA, following such investigation, to prepare a description of the incident (including  all items specified for E-A reports) and submit it to the area office as soon as possible, but no later than one week following commencement of the investigation. <p>Requires each employer engaged in construction work to file a report with OSHA upon completion of such work at a construction project.  Requires such reports to include information on work incidents, injuries, and deaths.  Requires that such information be used to: (1) determine the national incident rate average for each type of construction work; and (2) target for inspections high hazard construction operations, and employers that have a higher than average incident rate. <p>Revises provisions for civil and criminal penalties under the Act. <p>Raises to $25,000 the maximum civil penalty for each:  (1) willful or repeated violation (currently $10,000); (2) citation for a serious violation (currently $1,000); (3) citation for a violation determined not serious (currently $1,000); and (4) failure (per day) to correct a violation (currently $1,000). <p>Makes mandatory (currently discretionary) the assessment of a civil penalty against employers who fail to correct a violation against which a citation has been issued. <p>Adds criminal penalties for repeated violations of specified standards, rules, or orders under the Act and for failure to correct a violation for which a citation has been issued (as well as for willful violations), if that violation or failure caused death, serious injury, or illness to any employee, or was a serious violation under new provisions covering directors, officers, or agents of a corporate employer who knowingly authorize, order, or carry out violations, failures, or refusals to comply with orders under the Act.  Increases the maximum criminal penalties for such violations (after having increased their scope beyond willful violations resulting in an employee death) to $250,000 in fines and/or 20 years' imprisonment (currently $10,000 and/or six months), and, for violations committed after a first conviction, to $500,000 and/or ten years (currently $20,000 and/or one year). <p>Increases the maximum criminal penalties for giving advance notice of an inspection (without the authority of the Secretary or a designee under the Act) to $50,000 in fines and/or one year's imprisonment (currently, $1,000 and/or six months). <p>Increases the maximum criminal penalties for false statements, representations, or certifications under the Act to $100,000 in fines and/or one year's imprisonment (currently $10,000 and/or six months). <p>Increases the maximum civil penalty for a violation of posting requirements to $25,000 (currently $1,000). <p>Revises procedures for the payment of civil penalties to require that interest be charged against a person on any final order of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) or the U.S. district court.  Specifies such interest rate and requires accrual to begin 30 days after issuance of such order. <p>Subjects any director, officer, or agent of a corporate employer, who knowingly authorized, ordered, or carried out the employer's violation of a safety or health standard or knowing violation or failure or refusal to comply with an order issued under the Act, to the same civil penalties, criminal fines, and imprisonment that may be imposed on a person under applicable  provisions of the Act.  Prohibits the use of the assets of any business entity to pay, directly or indirectly, a penalty or fine imposed on a director, officer, or agent. <p>Establishes criminal penalties for any director, officer, or agent of any employer who discovers an occupational hazard at the workplace that could cause serious injury or illness to any employee and who fails, during the 15 day-period after such discovery (or immediately, if there is an imminent risk of bodily injury or death), to:  (1) inform the Assistant Secretary in writing, unless such person has actual knowledge that the Assistant Secretary has been so informed; and (2) warn affected employees in writing, unless such person has actual knowledge that such employees have been so warned.  Sets the maximum penalty for such violation at $250,000 in fines and/or ten years' imprisonment.  Prohibits fines from being paid, directly or indirectly, out of the assets of any business entity on behalf of such individual. <p>Establishes criminal penalties for any person who knowingly discriminates against any person in the terms or conditions of employment or in retention in employment or in hiring because of such person's having informed the Assistanct Secretary or warned employees of a serious concealed occupational hazard at the  workplace.  Sets the maximum penalty for such a violation at $250,000 in fines and/or ten years' imprisonment. Prohibits such fines from being paid, directly or indirectly, out of the assets of any business entity on behalf of such an individual. <p>Prohibits compromise, mitigation, or settlement of any proposed civil penalty that has been:  (1) issued under provisions for enforcement procedures under the Act, unless the affected employees or their representative have been given a full opportunity to participate in the process resulting in such an outcome; or (2) contested before the Commission under the Act, except with the Commission's approval. Prohibits compromise, mitigation, or settlement of any penalty assessment that has become a final order of the Commission, except with court approval. <p>Makes each instance a separate violation, for purposes of assessing civil penalties and fines, where there are multiple instances of a violation of a standard under the Act. <p>Considers a serious violation to exist in a place of employment if there is a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a condition that exists there, or from one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes that have been adopted or in use there, unless the employer did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation. <p>Subjects to criminal penalties, upon conviction, any person who knowingly distributes, offers for sale, introduces, or delivers in commerce any equipment (or components or accessories) for use at a construction site, if such equipment:  (1) is represented as complying with the provisions of the Act or any applicable specification or regulation of the Secretary; but (2) does not so comply. <p>Provides that no State or local law shall be superseded by any provision, order, or standard under the Act, unless such law is in conflict with it.  Provides that State or local safety and health laws are not in conflict with the Act if they provide standards which are either more stringent than or not provided by the Act.  Provides that nothing in the Act shall preclude State and local law enforcement agencies from engaging in criminal prosecutions in accordance with State or local laws. <p>Establishes a permit system for certain construction operations under the Act. <p>Requires the issuance of a permit by an E-A for an employment or place of employment prior to the commencement of any of the following covered operations:  (1) the construction of trenches and excavations that are five feet or deeper and into which a person is required to descend; (2) the erection of scaffolding that is more than three stories high; (3) the demolition of any building, structure, or the dismantling of scaffolding, that is more than three stories high; (4) operations involving exposure to asbestos; (5) any other operation that OSHA determines involves an exposure of employees to death or serious bodily harm; and (6) any other operation on a specific project which involves an exposure to death or serious bodily harm. <p>Requires a construction industry employer to obtain such a permit by submitting an application demonstrating that the employer knows, complies with, and intends to comply with, all statutes, regulations, standards, and agency directives applicable to construction work generally and to the covered operation or operations specifically, including all requirements set forth in the Act.  Requires such an application to include a copy of:  (1) the Project Safety and Health Program Procedures; and (2) the Construction Process Plan and Hazard Analysis.  Requires only one application and one permit for two or more operations to be performed concurrently by the same employer. <p>Allows an employer who complies with the general application demonstration requirements to obtain an annual permit in lieu of an application and permit for each covered operation of that employer.  Requires the employer, before commencement of work on each new covered operation within the year covered by the annual permit, to:  (1) notify the project E-A of the nature, location, and intended date of commencement of such operation; and (2) certify that the demonstration made to obtain such annual permit continues to apply to such new operation.  Requires such notification to include copies of that portion of the Project Safety and Health Program and Procedures and the Construction Process Plan and Hazard Analysis that are applicable to such new operation or that have been revised since submission of the permit application. <p>Requires permit applications to be submitted to an E-A for certification (or to OSHA in the absence of a permit certified by an E-A).  Directs OSHA to establish a schedule of fees to cover the costs involved in investigating and issuing permits.  Requires employers to pay such fees to the E-A or OSHA prior to permit issuance. <p>Requires every employer issued a permit to post a copy or copies at or near each place of employment involving a covered operation (or at the nearest practicable location of such employer if the posting is impracticable at the site of an excavation). <p>Makes specified Federal criminal law penalties applicable to false statements made with respect to permit applications and information. <p>Requires that all construction projects be under the supervision of a professional E-A who is registered in the State where the project is located. <p>Makes the owner of the project responsible for designating the E-A.  (Considers the owner to have joint responsibility where the project contract specifically assigns such responsibility to a project or construction manager or a prime or general contractor.) <p>Makes the E-A responsible for:  (1) determining whether a project's size or complexity requires the designation of qualified representatives of the E-A to ensure that the work is performed in compliance with all provisions, orders, and standards under the Act; (2) assuring that an adequate number of qualified designated representatives (meeting requirements for being competent persons) are assigned to the project; and (3) the actions, and compliance with the Act, of the designated representatives.  Makes the E-A liable to the same extent that the supervisor is liable for violations of the Act. <p>Requires posting at each construction project, near the OSHA poster, of the name and registration number of the E-A and the names of all designated representatives.  Allows, in such instances, work on the project to be performed only when the E-A's designated representative or representatives will be present on the work site.  Allows work on a construction project to be performed only when the E-A is present on the site, unless the E-A determines and certifies that a designated representative will be present on the site and will be sufficient to assure that the work will be performed in compliance with all provisions, orders, and standards under this Act. <p>Makes the owner responsible for the development and implementation on the project of Project Safety and Health Program and Procedures (project procedures).  (Considers the owner to have joint responsibility where the project contract assigns such responsibility to a project or construction manager, contractor, or other person.)  Requires project procedures to be job-site specific, with benchmarks for monitoring compliance with the program.  Requires that specific duties and responsibilities for monitoring compliance with such procedures be assigned to the E-A or designated representatives.  Prohibits certain liability claims against labor-management committee members or labor unions if such a committee participates in monitoring project procedures. Directs the E-A to review project procedures, and to certify approval after determining that they:  (1) will adequately address safety and health-related conditions anticipated on the project; and (2) contain appropriate provisions for education and training of employers, supervisors, and employees in the recognition, avoidance, and prevention of unsafe and unhealthy conditions. <p>Requires an E-A to perform or supervise, and the project E-A to verify, any required design (or alterations or modifications in the design) of equipment, structures, temporary structures, drawings, or processes. <p>Requires the E-A to notify in writing the appropriate contractors and subcontractors performing work on the project of the existence of hazardous conditions or work practices that violate any Federal, State, or local safety and health laws or regulations, and of noncompliance with any project procedures. <p>Directs the E-A to notify the owner and to require that work be stopped or affected employees be removed from areas where an imminent danger exists. <p>Requires certification of designated representatives in the appropriate State.  Directs the Secretary to review and approve such State certification programs and to provide such certification where such State programs are not provided. <p>Requires every owner to prepare a construction process plan and hazard analysis for every construction project prior to commencement of work on that project.  (Considers the owner to have joint responsibility where the project contract assigns such responsibility to a project or construction manager or a project or general contractor.) Requires E-A review and approval of such plan and analysis prior to commencement of work on the project.  Requires such plan and analysis to include specified components. Requires the prime or general contractor to provide every other contractor and subcontractor, prior to their commencement of work on the project, with a copy of such plan and analysis.  Requires every contractor and subcontractor to maintain the plan and analysis throughout its presence on the project and to make such available for review by its employees and employee representatives. Requires all contractors and subcontractors on the project to observe the construction process plan, unless the E-A certifies an exception from one or more aspects of the plan. <p>Requires the project E-A, prior to the commencement of work on a construction project, to certify to OSHA project compliance with all requirements relating to the permit system for certain hazardous construction operations, and with the health and safety supervisory rules for all construction projects under the Act. <p>Authorizes the Secretary, with the approval of the Advisory Committee on Construction, Safety and Health, to exempt from such requirements for all construction projects:  (1) certain sizes or types of construction operations, as determined appropriate by the Secretary; and (2) other construction operations, if they are being performed according to a specific plan that includes adequate safety and health procedures approved by an E-A.",,,,,,

Excludes from such definition closings or layoffs resulting from part or all of the employer's business being: (1) sold, if the purchaser either agrees to offer employment to the employee with no more than a six-month break in employment or, within 30 days after the purchase, offers such employment to the employee with no more than such a six-month break; or (2) relocated or consolidated, if, prior to the closing or layoff, the employer offers to transfer the employee, with no more than a six-month break in employment, either to a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting distance or to any other site of employment regardless of distance if in the latter case the employee accepts within 30 days after the offer or closing or layoff, whichever is later. <p>Provides for reduction of such 60-day notification period if:  (1) the closing or layoff is caused by business circumstances not reasonably foreseeable; or (2) giving notification of the shutdown of a single site of employment would have precluded (in the employer's reasonable and good faith belief) obtaining the capital or business which it was actively seeking and which would enable it to avoid or indefinitely postpone the shutdown.  Requires employers who rely on exemptions from the 60-day notification period requirement to give as much notice as is practicable, along with a brief statement of the basis for reducing the notification period. <p>Treats as employment losses layoffs of more than six months which, at their outset, were announced to be layoffs of six months or less, unless:  (1) the extension beyond six months is caused by business circumstances (including unforeseeable changes in price or cost) not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff; and (2) notice is given at the time it becomes reasonably foreseeable that the extension beyond six-months will be required. <p>Treats as a plant closing or mass layoff employment losses within any 90-day period for two or more groups at a single site of employment, each of which separately is less than the minimum required to trigger notification, but which in the aggregate exceed such minimum, unless the employer demonstrates that such employment losses are the result of separate and distinct actions and causes and are not an attempt by the employer to evade the requirements of this Act. <p>Exempts from the notification requirements of this Act a plant closing or mass layoff if:  (1) it results from completion of a particular project or undertaking, or the closing of a temporary facility, and the affected employees were hired with the understanding that their employment was limited to the duration of such project, undertaking, or facility; or (2) it constitutes a strike or a lockout not intended to evade the requirements of this Act. <p>Makes an employer who orders a plant closing or mass layoff in violation of the notice requirements of this Act liable to employees for back pay and benefits and subject to civil penalties for violations with respect to a local government.  Creates a cause of action in the appropriate U.S. district court to enforce such liability.  Authorizes the court in such cases to require the defendant to pay reasonable attorneys' fees, along with the costs of the action. States that such remedies shall be the exclusive remedies for any violation of this Act. <p>States that the rights and remedies provided to employees by this Act are in addition to any other contractual or statutory rights and remedies of the employees. <p>Declares that it is the sense of Congress that any employer not subject to the notice requirements should, to the extent possible, notify its employees about a proposal to close a plant or permanently reduce its workforce. <p>Directs the Secretary of Labor to prescribe regulations to carry out this Act, including interpretative regulations describing the methods by which employers may provide for appropriate service of notice. <p>Provides that the giving of notice in good faith compliance with this Act shall not constitute a violation of the National Labor Relations Act or the Railway Labor Act.",,,,,,

Limits such an emergency action to 30 days unless a limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding is begun before the expiration of that period.  Directs the Secretary to provide the lender, upon request, an opportunity to show cause that the emergency action is unwarranted. <p>Includes violations of or failures to carry out any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation among the violations and failures for which the Secretary may prescribe regulations to limit, suspend, or terminate the title IV program eligibility of an institution and may impose civil penalties. <p>Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations for:  (1) emergency actions against institutions, individuals, or private, for-profit organizations that have contracted with institutions to administer any aspect of the institution's student assistance program; and (2) the limitation, suspension, or termination of eligibility of such an individual or private, for-profit organization to enter into such a contract. <p>Prohibits an eligible institution from measuring the length of a course of study or academic year on a credit hour basis for title IV purposes if it is licensed by the State to provide such a course measured by the State on a clock hour basis.

Requires that such report be updated annually. <p>Directs each State to establish a water well drilling program which, at a minimum, requires that: (1) water well drillers be licensed; (2) waters from new or altered wells be analyzed for contaminants; (3) drinking groundwater wells be isolated from sources of contamination and other wells not be located or constructed in a manner which spreads contamination; and (4) information concerning completed or abandoned wells be recorded. <p>Requires that before real property is transferred, wells used for drinking or household needs be analyzed for contaminants and the results of such analysis be provided to prospective buyers.  Prohibits transfer of such property until abandoned wells are plugged. Directs the Administrator to conduct a survey and report to the Congress by July 1, 1990, on abandoned water supply and other production and injection wells, including recommendations for the prevention of water contamination from abandoned water supply and other wells. <p>Directs the Administrator to conduct national groundwater quality surveys to determine the effect various contaminant sources have on groundwater quality and the measures that may be effective in preventing contamination.  Authorizes the Governor of any State to petition the Administrator to initiate a nationwide survey of additional sources.  Requires the Administrator to notify: (1) public water systems and private households of the presence of contaminants in their water; and (2) government officals of the need for corrective action.  Sets forth reporting requirements. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to require the owner or operator of a source or potential source of contaminants, or a source of contaminants abandoned within the previous ten years to notify a designated State or local agency of such source and the effects of contaminants from such source.  Subjects owners and operators who knowingly fail to submit accurate information to a civil monetary penalty. <p>Requires each State to undertake a continuing program to compile, publish, and submit to the Administrator an inventory describing the location of each drinking water well within such State which has been closed or restricted for use because the groundwater is nonpotable. Requires the owners and operators of such wells to provide the State with specified information regarding such wells.  Subjects owners and operators who knowingly fail to submit accurate information to a civil monetary penalty. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) conduct programs and provide technical assistance to other governmental or nonprofit programs monitoring contaminants and other parameters in groundwater and soil, water, and vapors in the unsaturated zone; and (2) establish protocols for, and train and certify persons who will engage in groundwater sampling, analysis, and data management. <p>Provides that where the discharge from a source or potential source of contaminants has the potential to contaminate ground within the vicinity, the source owner or operator must monitor groundwater, and, where appropriate, soils and water in the unsaturated zone.  Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) issue rules and guidelines for such site-specific monitoring; (2) require owners and operators of sources or potential sources of contaminants to install conduct monitoring of soil, water, and vapors in the unsaturated zone whenever such monitoring is practicable and reliable and discharges present a substantial threat of groundwater contamination; and (3) require manufacturers or importers of substances which contaminate or have the potential to contaminate the groundwater to monitor groundwater and soil, water, and vapor in the unsaturated zone at a representative number of substance sites and conduct a national exposure assessment to determine the public health risks of groundwater contamination when such substances may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to issue an order requiring the owner or operator of a contaminant source which is presenting or may present a threat of injury or damage to human health, welfare, or the environment, or exceeds this Act's groundwater protection standards to assess the nature and extent of contamination.  Requires the owner or operator to submit a source monitoring plan to the Administrator within 15 days of issuance of the order.  Provides that where the contaminant source is the application of a pesticide in accordance with label instructions or widespread and usual practice, the Administrator may require the registrant of the pesticide to conduct the contamination assessment. Subjects owners and operators who fail to comply with an order of the Administrator to a civil monetary penalty. <p><b>Part C: Prevention</b> - Directs the Administrator to publish guidance, within 30 months of this Act's enactment, for the establishment of State Control Programs applicable to categories of sources or potential sources of contaminants.  Provides that such guidance may include requirements: (1) relating to source location, design, installation, operations, operator training, maintenance, leak detection, groundwater monitoring, record-keeping, corrective action, closure, and financial responsibility; and (2) varying among source types, different regions of the country, and new and existing sources.  Requires the Governor of each State to prepare and submit to the Administrator for approval State Control Programs for the prevention of groundwater contamination. Requires that contaminant sources be in compliance with all requirements of a State Control Program within two years of the Program's approval unless the owner or operator has been granted a variance which will not result in unreasonable risk to human health or the environment.  Provides for the waiver of Program requirements with respect to a particular source in certain cases where a waiver will not pose an unreasonable risk to human health or lead to adverse economic consequences which are not significantly outweighed by resulting social and economic benefits.  Requires each Program to monitor the compliance of sources with Program requirements, enforce such requirements, and describe the authorities and resources available to the State to take corrective action when a discharge or threatened discharge from a source may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment.  Requires that Programs be evaluated at least quadrennially to ensure that they are of sufficient stringency and effectiveness to prevent the violation of this Act's primary groundwater protection standards.  Authorizes the Administrator to withdraw approval of a Program when the State is not administering and enforcing it in accordance with the guidance of the Administrator and does not take appropriate action to bring the Program into compliance within 90 days after notification of noncompliance.  Waives this Act's discharge permit requirement for source owners or operators who are in compliance with Program requirements. <p>Subjects new contaminant sources to a second set of requirements written by the Administrator calling for use of the best practicable technology in controlling discharges.  Authorizes States to develop and submit to the Administrator a program for enforcing such requirements. <p>Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations, within 30 months of this Act's enactment, which reflect the greatest degree of control economically achievable through the application of the best available technology or management practice for sources or potential sources of contaminants.  Requires that the Administrator, in establishing performance requirements, give priority to measures which reduce the volume and toxicity of contaminants handled or discharged over processes which merely contain, capture, or treat contaminants prior to discharge. Requires the Administrator to review and revise such regulations at least once every five years.

Sets forth examples of such actions.  Requires an owner or operator of a contaminant source who obtains information indicating that the source is contaminating groundwater to report to the Administrator on the concentration of the contaminant detected, its location, and such other information the Administrator requires to determine whether corrective action is required.  Requires that such owners or operators also notify persons relying upon the groundwater for drinking or household needs of the contamination if it poses a threat to human health. <p>Provides that when a contaminant is present in groundwater at a concentration that reaches or exceeds 50 percent of a primary groundwater protection standard, the owner or operator of the contaminant source must implement a plan to cease or modify operations so that the contaminant will not reach such standard.  Directs the Administrator to issue an order prohibiting further operation of or discharges from a contaminant source which reaches and exceeds such standard and requiring that action be taken to prevent the spread of the contaminant.  Provides that when a contaminant is present in groundwater at a concentration that substantially exceeds the correction standard for such contaminant or otherwise threatens human health and the environment, the Administrator shall order the source owner or operator to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study for the Administrator's use in selecting remedial measures.  Requires the Administrator to order post-remedial care, after the successful implementation of remedial measures, which may include monitoring of soil and water within the vicinity of the source or maintenance of systems preventing contaminant discharge.  Authorizes the imposition of corrective action requirements as part of the discharge permit pocess. <p>Subjects owners and operators of contaminant sources to liability for: (1) corrective action costs incurred by Federal, State, or local governments or other persons; (2) all damages for economic loss or loss due to personal injury or loss of natural resources resulting from a discharge which contaminates groundwater resources.  Sets forth defenses to such liability.  Subjects persons who are liable for a release or threatened release of contaminants and fail without sufficient cause to take corrective measures upon the Administrator's order to punitive damages. <p>Provides that, when it is not technically impractical, corrective measures shall be designed to prevent the concentration of a groundwater contaminant from reaching or exceeding the primary groundwater protection standard for such contaminant and if this is not possible, to prevent it from exceeding the correction standard for such contaminant.  Authorizes the Administrator to select alternative corrective action measures when the preceding measures are technically impractical from an engineering perspective.  Sets up an appeals process for individuals adversely affected by such alternative measures.  Authorizes the Administrator to select corrective measures designed to prevent the exceeding of a secondary groundwater protection standard, but only where such measures would provide cost effective protection of groundwater.  Requires that corrective measures incorporating treatment to permanently and significantly reduce the volume, toxicity, or mobility of contaminants be selected in preference to measures which merely contain such contaminants or remove them to other sites. <p>Authorizes States to conduct their own corrective action programs provided the programs furnish protection for human health, welfare, and the environment at least equal to the protection afforded by the Federal program and follow guidelines to be promulgated by the Administrator.  Gives the Administrator the authority to review and disapprove State corrective action orders prior to their implementation.  Requires States which are conducting their own programs to bear 50 percent of the corrective action costs not borne by source owners or operators. <p>Provides for public participation in the development of the administrative record on which the Administrator or State will base selection of corrective action measures. <p>Authorizes appropriations to a revolving fund to be established in the Department of the Treasury to carry out the corrective action program. <p>Subjects source operators who knowingly violate a primary groundwater protection standard, and owners or operators who fail to report information indicating that the source is contaminating groundwater, to civil monetary penalties. <p>Establishes a Federal program, in partnership with the States, to compensate owners or lesses of property which is not served by a public water supply for the costs of testing, treating, or replacing contaminated wells supplying drinking water or water suitable for other household uses.

Rept. 100-483)  <p>Thrift Charter Enhancement Act of 1988 - Amends the National Housing Act to increase the limit on the aggregate amount of transactions or service agreements allowed between federally insured thrift institutions and their affiliates without the prior approval of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) in cases of GAAP-qualified insured institutions.  Increases such limit from the lesser of to the greater of $100,000 or 0.1 percent of the thrift institution's total assets, up to a maximum of $2,000,000 for transactions and $1,000,000 for service agreements. <p>Defines a ""GAAP-qualified insured institution"" as an insured institution: (1) whose capital equals or exceeds the greater of five percent of total assets or the minimum capital level prescribed by the FSLIC; and (2) that is not affiliated with an insured institution whose capital is less than three percent of total assets.  Exempts an institution from the three percent capital requirement if it:  (1) is affiliated due to the acquisition of a failed or failing institution; (2) has capital of not less than zero; (3) has submitted a plan to the FSLIC for increasing capital to at least three percent within four years and the FSLIC has determined such plan to be feasible; and (4) is in compliance with such plan. <p>Allows a savings and loan holding company to acquire up to five percent of the voting shares of an unaffiliated thrift institution or savings and loan holding company.  (Present law prohibits the acquisition of any voting shares of an unaffiliated institution unless the holding company has, or is acquiring, control of such thrift institution.) <p>Repeals requirements under the National Housing Act for prior FSLIC approval for interlocking directors of savings and loan holding companies (leaving the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act of 1978 as the governing statute.) <p>Allows a savings and loan holding company or any nonthrift subsidiary thereof to assume or incur debt without the prior approval of the FSLIC if each of the holding company's insured institution subsidiaries is a GAAP-qualified insured institution.",,,,,,

(Current law imposes such duties on the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and agency heads but not on the President.)  Specifies that such requirement shall not be construed as:  (1) requiring the approval of the intelligence committees to initiate such activities; or (2) limiting the President's powers conferred by the Constitution to initiate such activities. <p>Requires the President to ensure that any illegal intelligence activity is reported to the intelligence committees, as well as any corrective action taken or planned in connection with such illegal activity. (Current law imposes this duty only on the DCI and agency heads, subject to certain conditions.) <p>Provides statutory authority for the President to authorize special activities only when he determines such activities are necessary to support U.S. foreign policy objectives and are important to national security.  (Current law does not provide express statutory authorization for special activities.)  Requires that such determination be set forth in a finding that meets the following conditions:  (1) each finding must be in writing, unless immediate action is required and time does not permit a written finding (in which case a written record of the President's decision would have to be contemporaneously made and reduced to a written finding as soon as possible but not later than 48 hours after the decision is made); (2) each finding must specify each Government entity authorized to fund or otherwise participate significantly in such special activities; and (3) each finding must specify any third party not subject to Government regulations who will be used to fund or otherwise participate in a special activity. Prohibits a finding from:  (1) authorizing any action which violates the Constitution or any statutes of the United States; (2) authorizing or sanctioning special activities which have already occurred; or (3) authorizing any action intended to influence U.S. political processes, public opinion policies, or media. <p>Requires the President to ensure that any such finding be reported to the intelligence committees as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours after it has been signed.  Allows the President, on occasions when time is of the essence, to direct that special activities be initiated prior to reporting such activities to the intelligence committees, provided that notice is provided to the intelligence committees as soon as possible but in no event later than 48-hours after the finding authorizing such activities is signed or the determination to conduct such activities is made. <p>Allows the President, in extraordinary circumstances, to limit the reporting of such findings or determinations to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the intelligence committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, but requires that he provide a statement of the reasons for limiting access.

Authorizes each State to: (1) make an assessment as to whether immediate employment is a realistic possibility or whether training or education is needed to prepare registered applicants and recipients for employment; (2) provide applicants and recipients with counseling regarding their prospects and needs; (3) require AFDC applicants to undertake an immediate program of job search; and (4) develop an employment plan for each AFDC recipient. <p>Requires States to provide AFDC recipients who are assigned to employment, training, or education programs, and applicants who are required to participate in job search, with child care and transportation services, otherwise such applicants and recipients need not participate in such programs. <p>Sets the Federal share of AFDC employment, training, and education costs in excess of FY 1987 costs at 50 percent.  Establishes participation standards which require State AFDC employment, training, and education programs to include a specified annual percentage (increasing from 15 percent in FY 1988 to 70 percent in FY 1996 and thereafter) of a State's mandatory AFDC population.  Requires 80 percent of such population within the ages of 16 and 18 to be attending school on a full-time basis by FY 1990.  Reduces Federal funding for States which fall short of such participation standards. <p>Authorizes appropriations for AFDC employment, training, and education programs.  Expresses the congressional intent that such funding be increased after FY 1988 if and to the extent such programs prove successful in reducing welfare dependency.  Ensures that each State receive at least as much funds for such programs in FY 1988 and 1989 as it did in FY 1987.  Provides that after FY 1989 50 percent of such funds shall be allotted on the basis of a State's share of the total participating AFDC population and 50 percent on the basis of the relative success of each State in placing high-priority AFDC applicants and recipients (high school dropouts, unwed mothers with children under age three, and AFDC recipients under age 22) in school or jobs for six months or more. <p>Requires Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam to each implement a coordinated program of activities affording individuals the opportunity to achieve self-sufficiency through employment.

Limits the applicability of such certificates to the child care necessary to permit their recipients' employment or search for employment. Provides for Federal reimbursement of program costs as though they were costs incurred in providing child care to individuals assigned to an AFDC employment, training, and education program. Requires providers participating in the child care certificate program to be licensed or certified by the State, but certain providers shall be given two years to comply with State licensing or certification requirements.

Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to withhold Federal payments for certificate program costs upon a State's substantial failure to comply with program requirements.  Sets forth reporting requirements. <p><b>Title IV:  Child Support Enforcement Amendments</b> - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act to direct States to establish binding guidelines for child support award amounts. (Currently, such guidelines need not be binding).  Creates a rebuttable presumption that the child support award resulting from the application of such guidelines in a judicial or administrative child support proceeding is correct. Requires States to review and update all child support orders at least once every two years to ensure that they continue to comply with child support award guidelines. <p>Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Act to authorize up to ten States to carry out demonstration projects which require absent parents who owe child support, but whose income is insufficient to pay such support to participate in a employment or training program. <p>Amends part D of title IV of the Act to require that the names and social security numbers of the father and mother of every child born in a State be recorded on such child's birth certificate. <p>Requires States to adopt certain procedures with regard to paternity determinations and the standard of proof in paternity cases.  Takes a State's paternity determinations into account in computing the State child support collection incentive payment. <p>Requires each State to adopt procedures:  (1) requiring employers to disclose certain information to the State child support enforcement agency regarding any employee who is under court order to pay child support; and (2) making certain legislation regarding the interstate enforcement of child support effective in the State. Provides that when the State in which the custodial parent resides requests the State in which the absent parent resides to modify a support order, the latter State shall not have jurisdiction to modify any other aspect of the order. <p>Requires that by October 1992 every State have in effect an operational child support management information system.  Reduces the Federal share of the costs for such systems. <p>Requires the withholding of child support payments from the non-custodial parent's wages upon the issuance or modification of a child support order unless both parents agree in writing to an alternative arrangement or the parent paying child support posts a bond equal to six months of child support. <p>Requires that the Parent Locator Service and the State agency administering the State child and spousal support plan be given access to all employment security information which is in the possession or control of any Federal or interstate telecommunications network or is available through any other data exchange method, and is to be used for child support enforcement purposes. <p>Directs the Secretary to develop and publish standards within one year of this Act's enactment for the amount of time a State may take to complete each of several actions in child support cases.  Penalizes States which fail to comply with such standards. <p>Makes this title's amendments effective one year after this Act's enactment.  Directs the Comptroller General to evaluate State implementation of this title's amendments and report to the President and the Congress regarding such evaluation within four years of this Act's enactment. <p><b>Title V:  State Demonstration Programs</b> - Requires States that wish to conduct demonstration programs which include Federal, Federally-assisted, or non-Federal public programs designed to alleviate poverty to submit filings regarding such demonstrations to an Interagency Low-Income Opportunity Board which shall select and approve those demonstrations judged worthy of implementation.  Sets forth policy goals to be considered by the Board in selecting and evaluating such demonstrations.  Directs that special consideration be given to demonstration programs designed to:  (1) improve methods of helping welfare recipients achieve economic independence; (2) coordinate employment and training programs currently supported by Federal or State funds; (3) establish paternity and obtain child support orders in AFDC cases for which paternity was not established when the case was opened; (4) facilitate efforts by nongovernmental organizations to help welfare clients achieve economic independence. <p>Requires a Governor or his designee to submit a filing which describes in detail the demonstration program to be conducted, including:  (1) employment-related activities required of individuals receiving assistance under the demonstration and the circumstances in which they will not be required to participate in such activities; (2) procedures for determining the initial and continuing eligibility of, and benefits for, individuals and families; (3) a budget setting forth the amounts  and sources of funding for the demonstration.  Requires each Federal department or agency with responsibility for a program which is included in the demonstration program to make an estimate of funding which, but for the demonstration, would be available for such programs so that the Chairman may compare State budgetary assumptions with such estimate.  Provides that when the amount of Federal funds necessary to carry out the demonstration is less than the amount contained in the budget by reason of the effectiveness of the demonstration in achieving the objectives of this title, the State may use excess Federal funds to improve the demonstration or otherwise benefit individuals and families included in the demonstration. <p>Provides that those within a class eligible to participate in a demonstration shall only be eligible for benefits under a program included in such demonstration. <p>Requires the Board to conduct interim evaluations of, and have States submit annual reports on, demonstrations.  Authorizes the submittal of demonstration changes for congressional approval if such changes improve the likelihood of accomplishing this title's objectives and participant benefits are not thereby reduced. Authorizes State Governors or the Chairman of the Board to terminate the demonstration (upon giving the Chairman or Governor at least three months advance notice) if the interests of the Federal Government, the State, or the participating individuals would be better served by returning to the separate conduct of the included programs. <p>Requires a Governor, within six months of the completion of a demonstration, to submit a final report on such demonstration to the Board.  Directs the Chairman to report annually to the Congress on demonstrations. <p>Directs the Board, after selecting and approving demonstration programs in accordance with criteria it establishes, to prepare a single demonstration proposal containing all information pertinent to the programs selected. Provides that the proposal shall be submitted to the Congress and become effective unless the Congress passes legislation modifying or rejecting the proposal within 60 days after its submission by the Board. <p><b>Title VI:  Evaluation of Employment and Training Programs and State Demonstration Programs</b> - Directs the Secretary to convene an Interagency Panel within three months of this Act's enactment which shall design, implement, and monitor a series of studies assessing the methods and effects of the programs initiated under titles II and V of this Act.  Requires the Panel to select an advisory board of not more than 12 members, within six months of this Act's enactment, to provide the Panel with advice and counsel on all aspects of its operation.  Requires the Panel to ensure that a study of child care during the welfare-to-work transition period is conducted during the first three years of its operation.  Sets forth Panel reporting requirements.  Authorizes appropriations for the Panel. <p><b>Title VII:  Miscellaneous and Related Provisions</b> - Authorizes the Secretary to approve a five-year demonstration project testing Washington State's Family Independence Program as an alternative to the AFDC program.",,,,,,

Revises the definition of ""unreasonable"" as used under such Act to include acts which:  (1) deny fair and equitable market or business enterprise opportunities; (2) fail to provide adequate protection of intellectual property rights; and (3) provide, directly or indirectly, any subsidy to increase the capacity to produce a nonagricultural, fungible good for which existing worldwide production already significantly exceeds worldwide demand.  Defines any act, policy, or practice as burdening or restricting the United States if such act, policy, or practice threatens to have an adverse impact on U.S. commerce. <p>Outlines actions to be taken by the USTR in obtaining information from a foreign country in the course of any investigation to determine whether such country is engaged in an unreasonable trade practice, including receiving documentation and verification of all information to be relied upon as part of any such investigation.  Authorizes the USTR to disregard any information that is untimely, incomplete, or not documented or verified to the satisfaction of the USTR. <p>Requires the USTR, within eight months after the initiation of an unreasonable trade practice investigation, to make a determination regarding such investigation, and, if such determination is in the affirmative, to recommend actions that the President should take to eliminate such acts, policies, or practices. Requires such determinations to be published by the USTR in the Federal Register. <p><b>Title II:  Negotiating Objectives</b> - Defines as a principal negotiating objective under the Trade Act of 1974 the obtaining of an agreement that imposes sanctions against the provision of government subsidies for increasing the production capacity of a nonagricultural, fungible good for which existing worldwide production already significantly exceeds worldwide demand. <p><b>Title III:  Relief From Import Competition</b> - Revises provisions relating to investigations by the International Trade Commission (ITC) to determine eligibility for import relief from injury caused by import competition to include as appropriate circumstances justifying such relief an increase in the worldwide capacity to produce the article under investigation if the article is a nonagricultural, fungible article and such increase is likely to result in increased imports of the article or result in the reduction or suppression of the price of the article in domestic or worldwide markets. <p>Directs the President, in determining what actions to take in providing import relief to damaged parties, to:  (1) consult with the interagency trade organization created under the Trade Expansion Act of 1972 and consider the recommendations and written analyses of such organization; and (2) take into account written analyses prepared and submitted to the President by the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Commerce, and the USTR containing specified information on the effect of import relief on consumers and the industry involved.  Requires the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Commerce, and the USTR to solicit, receive, and evaluate comments from interested parties in preparing their written analyses.  Directs the written analyses and recommendations made by the interagency trade organization referred to above to be made available to the public at the time they are submitted to the President. <p>Expands the import relief options available to the President to include the entering into of multilateral negotiations to prevent or remedy the injury if the injury is not susceptible to unilateral solution by the United States, including injury (or threat of injury) from excess worldwide capacity to produce a specified article.  Authorizes the ITC to recommend to the President, after a finding that injury is present for which import relief is justified, that the President enter into multilateral negotiations to prevent or remedy the injury, if the ITC determines that the United States cannot remedy such injury by unilateral action.  Directs the ITC to consider the potential for evasion of remedies prescribed, and to include in their recommendations to the President any means that could be used by the President to prevent such evasion.  Authorizes the President to take any appropriate actions to avoid such evasions. <p><b>Title IV:  Antidumping and Countervailing Duties</b> - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to direct the ITC, when conducting a countervailing or antidumping duty investigation, to consider whether excess worldwide capacity to produce the merchandise in question has had an effect on reducing or suppressing the price of the merchandise in the United States.  Directs the ITC to take the same question into consideration when determining whether material injury has been suffered or is threatened. <p><b>Title V:  International Financial Institutions</b> - Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (the Fund) to present proposals to the Executive Board of the Fund at the earliest practicable time to ensure that countries experiencing a shortfall in export earnings from nonagricultural fungible commodities due to a decline in prices as a result of a world surplus cannot borrow from the compensatory financing facility of the Fund unless such country enters into an agreement with the Fund to adjust production and not add further to the excess capacity of the product, and to take any other necessary action to stabilize the market for such commodity.  Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund to vote against the provision of any loans from the Fund to countries producing surplus commodities before the Executive Board implements the above provision. <p>Directs the Secretary, beginning 90 days after the enactment of this Act and at 90-day intervals until three years after the enactment of this Act, to submit a report to the President and the Congress listing all reports which have been circulated in the international financial institutions during the preceding 90 days for project assistance which would establish or enhance the capacity of any country other than the United States to produce a commodity for export if:  (1) such commodity is in world surplus or is likely to be in surplus if such projects are permitted; and (2) such assistance will cause substantial injury to U.S. producers of the commodity involved. Requires such report to also describe requests by any of the major copper-producing countries for assistance from the Fund. <p>Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. representatives to the international financial institutions to take into account the effect that adjustment assistance would have on individual industry sectors and international commodity markets.",,,,,,

Reimburses States for 85 percent of their expenses in providing the minimum benefit for FY 1989 through 1991 and for 90 percent of such expenses thereafter. <p>Requires States to make AFDC payments with respect to dependent children of unemployed parents in two-parent families. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Work-Related Requirements</b> - Requires, with certain exceptions, AFDC applicants and recipients to register with a State agency for employment counseling, training, and assignment. <p>Directs such State agency to:  (1) determine the appropriate employment-related activities for each registered AFDC applicant or recipient; and (2) arrange for their participation in one or more of the employment-related programs established under title IV of the Act or other Federal law, while coordinating such programs to enhance the availability and efficiency of services provided. <p>Requires the State agency to provide AFDC applicants and recipients assigned to employment, training, or education programs with child care and transportation services. <p>Sets the Federal contribution to education, training, and assignment costs at 75 percent in FY 1988 and a percentage in subsequent years which is determined by use of a specified formula which takes into account a State's compliance with performance standards to be developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  Provides that such standards shall measure a State's success in reducing welfare costs and helping AFDC recipients achieve self-sufficiency.  Sets the Federal share of administrative costs at 50 percent.  Authorizes appropriations to carry out the activities under this title, allotting such funds among States on the basis of each State's share of AFDC recipients. <p>Gives States the option, when a family's increased income renders them ineligible for AFDC, to:  (1) continue to cover a family's child care, transportation, and other employment-related support service expenses for the year after such family's eligibility would otherwise end; and (2) require a family contribution for such services. <p><b>Subtitle C:  Child Support Enforcement</b> - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Act to alter the rules of State eligibility for child support collection incentive payments.

Requires, in addition, that families receiving part F services not be eligible for child care under the AFDC program and include parent(s) who are adolescent, working, enrolled in education or training programs, or seeking employment. Authorizes appropriations. <p>Requires a State to report to the Secretary on its intended use of part F payments before expending such funds.  Authorizes States to impose a fee for child care services which may vary on the basis of a family's ability to pay.  Requires that fees collected be used only to provide child care to children covered by this Act. Establishes a formula for determining the State child care assistance percentage which takes into account the State's taxable resources and the number of children at risk of neglect or abuse in the State, but prohibits such percentage from being less than 50 percent. <p><b>Subtitle E:  Hold Harmless</b> - Reimburses States for all of their AFDC expenditures in FY 1989 which exceed State AFDC expenditures in FY 1988 and are attributable to this Act's amendments. <p><b>Title II:  Medicaid</b> - Extends Medicaid eligibility to pregnant women and children up to age five whose family income does not exceed the Federal poverty level.  Extends the Medicaid age eligibility limit for children on a gradual basis so that by FY 1999 children up to age 16 are covered.  Requires the Secretary to establish uniform national standards regarding the types of Medicaid services provided to such individuals. <p>Directs States to provide Medicaid coverage to individuals who are eligible for benefits under title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Act or would be eligible for such benefits if they were not in a medical institution.  Authorizes States to provide Medicaid coverage to individuals eligible for participation in certain other social security programs, but requires the State plan to include at least one group not covered under such programs. <p>Raises the limit on the Medicaid Federal assistance percentage to 90 percent.  Sets such percentage at:  (1) 100 percent for medical services provided through Indian Health Service facilities; and (2) 80 percent for FY 1988, 85 percent for FY 1989 through 1991, and 90 percent thereafter for medical assistance provided to pregnant women and children pursuant to this Act.  Provides for annual reductions in the State percentage.  Reimburses States for all of their Medicaid expenditures in FY 1988 and 1989 which exceed State Medicaid expenditures in FY 1987 and are attributable to this Act's amendments. Extends the moratorium on the reduction of payments to States for high erroneous payment rates under the AFDC and Medicaid programs for one year.  (Currently, the moratorium is set to expire on July 1, 1988.) <p><b>Title III:  Termination or Reduction of Certain Federal Programs</b> - Abolishes certain programs providing Federal assistance for:  (1) economically distressed areas; (2) urban mass transit systems; (3) community services and development (including the Urban Development Action Grant program); (4) education (including impact aid); (5) vocational education and manpower training; and (6) water pollution control.

Makes such exemption available to SEAs as well as LEAs.  Repeals a provision allowing States to make certain allocations to LEAs rather than counties under specified conditions. <p>Eliminates a requirement that the State agency programs are to be fully funded and basic grant awards are to be ratably reduced where appropriations are not sufficient to fully fund all Chapter 1 programs. <p>Revises certain ESEA definitions applicable to Chapter 1 of the ECIA.

Prohibits the Board from imposing a dollar limit on the amount of goods an export trading company may maintain in inventory, unless such limit is necessary to prevent risks likely to adversely affect any subsidiary bank of an investor bank holding company. <p>Amends the Export Trading Company Act of 1982 to require an applicant for a certificate of review (authorizing the applicant to engage in export trade activities) to specify in such application the members seeking export trade protection with such applicant under the certificate.  Defines ""applicant"" for purposes of the issuance of such certificates.

Requires each Federal department to cooperate fully with the Secretary in providing requested information.  Requires a report of findings and recommendations resulting from such study to the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. <p>Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to provide that the ITC, when determining whether an increase in imports is a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to a domestic industry, should consider the condition of the industry over the course of the business cycle and shall not aggregate the causes of declining demand associated with a recession or economic downturn into a single cause of serious injury.  Repeals provisions directing the ITC to recommend adjustment assistance as a remedy for such injury.  Requires the ITC, in cases where it finds that specified import relief (for a period not to exceed five years) is necessary to prevent or remedy such injury, to determine whether a domestic industry (or segment thereof) would be competitive without further import relief.  Sets forth specified economic factors the ITC shall consider in making such competitiveness assessment.  Requires the ITC to recommend import relief of a scope and amount designed to assist a segment of an industry to become competitive if it finds that such industry can reasonably be expected to become competitive by the end of an appropriate period of import relief. <p>Requires that the President receive from the ITC an affirmative finding under the competitiveness assessment test in order to provide appropriate import relief.  Deletes provisions relating to presidential action on adjustment assistance petitions.  Adds to the factors to be considered by the President when making a determination to provide import relief:  (1) the likelihood that such relief would lead an industry to be competitive without further import relief upon the expiration of an appropriate period of such relief; and (2) any actions proposed by a trade association, firm, certified union, or group of workers to improve an industry's international competitive position. Deletes, with respect to the granting of such relief by the President, consideration of information relating to the extent to which workers in an industry have applied for adjustment assistance. Allows import relief to be reduced or terminated by the President upon a determination that the continuation of such relief:  (1) in its present form can no longer reasonably be expected to lead to an industry (or segment thereof) that would be competitive after the expiration of an appropriate period of such relief; or (2) is no longer necessary to ensure a competitive industry. <p>Requires the ITC, upon the request of the President or upon its own motion, to advise the President of its judgment as to the probable economic effect on the competitiveness of an industry (currently, on the industry) of the extension, reduction, or termination of such import relief.  Adds to the possible actions the President shall undertake if providing import relief: (1) the initiation of multilateral negotiations with foreign governments to address or otherwise alleviate the injury or threat of serious injury to such industry; and (2) the provision of Federal regulatory relief.  Directs the President, upon deciding to provide regulatory relief:  (1) to order an expedited review of any Federal regulatory requirement; and (2) upon completion of such review, to take appropriate action within his authority or direct the head of an Executive department or agency to take action to alter, ease, or eliminate such Federal requirement or, if such action is not within his authority or that of the Executive department or agency, to request that the Congress enact legislation to amend, ease, or eliminate such Federal regulatory requirement.  Exempts from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act information and documentary material filed pursuant to such regulatory relief provisions.  Prohibits such information or material from being made public except as may be relevant to administrative or judicial proceedings.  Permits disclosure to the Congress. <p>Requires the President, upon request from an industry producing a perishable agricultural product and upon a finding that there is a reasonable indication that such industry is vulnerable to serious and irreparable injury as a result of surges in imports of a like or directly competitive product, to request the ITC to investigate and monitor such imports for a period not be exceed two years. Permits a person who has filed a petition with the ITC alleging serious injury substantially caused by imports that are, on the date of filing, subject to investigation and monitoring by the ITC, to request that emergency action be taken with respect to such imports. Requires the ITC, if a request for emergency action has been made, to promptly make an investigation to determine whether:  (1) an increase in such imports of a perishable agricultural product is a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to an industry producing a like or directly competitive product; (2) the serious injury is likely to be difficult to repair by reason of the perishability of the like or directly competitive agricultural product of an industry; and (3) the serious injury cannot otherwise be prevented by an ITC investigation under normal time periods.  Requires the ITC, if it finds that such criteria have been met, to: (1) find that amount a duty or import restriction on such article which is necessary to prevent or remedy such injury; and (2) give preference to an increase in or imposition of a duty on such imports, if such relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy such injury.  Directs the ITC to report its findings to the President not later than 21 days after such a petition is filed. <p>Requires the President, upon receiving an affirmative finding from the ITC, to provide emergency import relief for such industry, unless within seven days he determines that provision of such relief is not in the U.S. national economic interest.  Requires the President, if he determines to provide such relief and in order to prevent the serious and irreparable injury or threat thereof, to:  (1) proclaim specified import relief; and/or (2) order the suspension of the liquidation of articles subject to such an affirmative finding that are entered or withdrawn from the warehouse after the date of such finding, and order the posting of a cash band for the entry of such articles.  Provides for the termination of such emergency relief. Requires petitions alleging serious injury from imports that are subject to ITC investigation and monitoring to indicate whether emergency action is requested. Prohibits such request from being made 90 days after the ITC initiates such investigation and monitoring. <p>Prohibits, with specified exceptions, the payment of trade adjustment assistance or the acceptance of petitions for such assistance by the Secretary of Labor after September 30, 1987.  Provides for the termination of the trade adjustment assistance program.  Repeals specified provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 relating to petitions for such assistance. <p>Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to take necessary actions to administer or liquidate grants, contracts, agreements, loans, or other obligations made by the Secretary. Sets forth provisions relating to the repayment of such loans and other obligations arising in connection with the payment of adjustment assistance prior to the effective date of this Act.  Authorizes appropriations for the termination of such assistance. <p>Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the determination of whether an act, policy, or practice by a foreign country is ""unreasonable"" to take into account reciprocal opportunities in the United States for foreign nations and firms. <p>Changes the deadline by which the United States Trade Representative (USTR) must make a recommendation to the President as to action that should be taken with respect to enforcement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, specified trade agreements under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, or unfair trade practices of foreign countries to the earlier of 30 days after the agreement's dispute settlement procedure is concluded or two years after the date the USTR investigation is initiated.  Allows waiver of time limits by the petitioner requesting relief.  Requires the USTR to submit semiannually a report to the Congress describing the commercial effects of actions to enforce such agreements or to respond to such unfair practices.  Allows the President to take action on his own motion to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements or respond to foreign trade practices. Requires the President to publish notice of his determination, including the reasons for it, in the Federal Register.  Requires the President, unless he determines that expeditious action is required, to provide a public hearing (if requested) before taking action. <p>Requires the USTR, upon  written request, to make available to any person information concerning the nature of a specific trade policy or practice of a foreign government with respect to particular goods, services, investments, or intellectual property rights. <p>Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to change the method of dealing with dumping by nonmarket economy countries.  Requires the administering authority, if it cannot determine the foreign market value of goods exported from a country with a State-controlled economy, to determine the foreign market value of such goods on the basis of the price at which comparable goods are sold at arm's length in the United States by the eligible market economy country with the lowest import price into the United States. Permits the administering authority, if the volume of imports from such eligible market economy country is insufficient to determine the foreign market value of such goods, to include additional eligible market economy countries in its determination of foreign market value.  Permits the administering authority, if it determines that the prices of the eligible market economy country with the lowest import price do not accurately reflect fair value, if such prices cannot be adequately ascertained or adjusted, or if there is no eligible market economy country, to determine foreign market value of goods on the basis of either another eligible market economy country or the constructed value of comparable goods in any country or countries other than a nonmarket economy country.  Sets forth provisions relating to the administering authority's access to public information with respect to determining import prices. <p>Defines ""eligible market economy country"" to mean a foreign country which is not a nonmarket economy country, in which comparable merchandise is produced for export to the United States, and which the administering authority determines is appropriate for use in calculating foreign market value, taking into account specified factors.  Defines ""lowest import price"" to mean the lowest average price of comparable merchandise that is sold to the United States from an eligible market economy country over the applicable period of an import investigation.  Defines ""comparable merchandise"" to mean merchandise contained in the same applicable numbers of the Tariff Schedules of the United States. <p>Allows the administering authority to suspend an investigation in which foreign market value is determined upon acceptance of an agreement with a nonmarket economy country to restrict the volume of imports of merchandise which is the subject of an investigation.  Provides that the countervailing duty laws shall not apply to merchandise from nonmarket economy countries. <p>Provides that component products introduced into U.S. commerce that are covered by an antidumping finding or an antidumping or countervailing duty order and that are assembled in the United States shall be covered by such orders, provided that:  (1) such components are imported from the country covered by such finding or order; (2) the value added in the United States is small in relation to the total value of the merchandise entered into the United States; and (3) such components were exported by a company related to the company performing the assembly in the United States.  Provides similar provisions with respect to merchandise that is assembled in third world countries and merchandise that has been slightly altered in form or appearance. <p>Revises the method of calculating foreign market value by adding that where taxes imposed in the country of exportation on exported merchandise are rebated or not collected, such value shall be decreased by the amount of such taxes imposed on such merchandise sold for home consumption. <p>Requires the ITC, within 180 days after the administering authority notifies the ITC that a countervailing duty order applies to merchandise for which there was no injury determination and that international obligations of the United States, as determined by the USTR, require such determination to be made, to make a determination of whether:  (1) an industry would be materially injured or threatened with material injury; or (2) the establishment of an industry would be materially retarded, if the outstanding countervailing duty order on imports of duty-free merchandise were revoked.  Suspends, pending receipt of the ITC's injury determination, the liquidation of entries covered by such order which are entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the date of the injury determination.  Requires the outstanding countervailing duty order, including any cash deposits, to remain in effect.  Requires the administering authority, pending receipt of the ITC's injury determination, to suspend any administrative review of such order which covers such merchandise  on or after the effective date of the injury requirement. <p>Requires the administering authority, upon an affirmative determination of injury by the ITC, to liquidate entries of merchandise that were suspended and to continue the suspension of liquidation and the collection of duties required to be deposited.  Requires the countervailing duty order to remain in effect",,,,,,

Requires the ITC, if the administering authority has made a preliminary determination as to whether a subsidy is being paid, to commence an investigation of injury as if such preliminary determination was made on the effective date of the injury requirement.  Requires the ITC to make:  (1) its preliminary determination of injury not later than 45 days after it receives notification from the administering authority that U.S. obligations require such determination; and (2) its final determination not later than 120 days after such notification. <p>Declares that the lawfulness of acts of importation into, or sale in, the United States of articles that infringe a valid U.S. patent, copyright, trademark, mask work, or trade secret shall be determined without regard to whether such acts have the effect of destroying, substantially injuring, or preventing the establishment of a U.S. industry.

Requires the court, in an action based on a contract, combination, or conspiracy among competitors, to conclusively presume that a person has been released from liability if: (1) such person has not been joined as a defendant; and (2) the defendant has established that such person is legally or practically available as a party to the action. <p>Requires damages based on a price-fixing agreement between competitors to be allocated on the basis of:  (1) each competitor's proportionate share of the total competitors' overcharges or underpayments where the claim is based on damages sustained by reason of overcharges or payments resulting from a price-fixing agreement; or (2) each party's relative responsibility for the origination or perpetration of the antitrust violation, whichever method the court determines to be more equitable. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Antitrust Remedies Improvement Act of 1987</b> - Amends the Clayton Act to reduce the amount recoverable in a private antitrust action from treble to actual damages sustained, except when the damages are sustained by reason of the plaintiff being overcharged or underpaid by the liable party.

Directs the court to hear and determine any motion to dismiss on such basis before conducting further proceedings.  Provides that nothing in this Act authorizes the court to consider the effect of an action sought to be dismissed on the foreign political relations of the United States. <p>Declares that the doctrine of forum non conveniens (providing that a court dismiss a case that should be tried in another more convenient and appropriate forum) shall be applicable in any antitrust action involving foreign commerce. <p><b>Subtitle D:  Interlocking Directorate Act of 1987</b> - Amends the Clayton Act to prohibit any person from serving as a director in two or more corporations if each (currently, any) of such corporations has capital, surplus, and undivided profits aggregating more than $10,000,000 (currently, $1,000,000).  Establishes exceptions to such interlocking directorate prohibition where the sales of each corporation of each product or service sold in competition with the other corporation's:  (1) are less than five percent of such corporation's total sales, unless such corporation's sales of all such products or services exceed 25 percent of its total sales; (2) added to such corporation's sales of all other such products or services are less than $1,000,000; or (3) are less than three percent of the total sales in each line of commerce in each section of the country in which such corporations compete.

Defines an ""intergovernmental regulation"" as a Federal regulation that requires a State or local government to take certain actions or to comply with certain conditions in order to receive Federal assistance.  Specifies the required contents of such report, which include:  (1) an estimate of the economic and noneconomic benefits that will be provided to each State government and to all local governments in such State as a result of compliance with each such regulation during each fiscal year; and (2) proposals for legislation and administrative actions to change regulations in order to reduce compliance costs or to achieve a more favorable balance between costs incurred and benefits received.

Repeals provisions directing the ITC to recommend adjustment assistance as a remedy for such injury.

Permits a person who has filed a petition with the ITC alleging serious injury substantially caused by imports that are, on the date of filing, subject to investigation and monitoring by the ITC, to request that emergency action be taken with respect to such imports.  Requires the ITC, if a request for emergency action has been made, to promptly make an investigation to determine whether: (1) an increase in such imports of a perishable agricultural product is a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to an industry producing a like or directly competitive product; (2) the serious injury is likely to be difficult to repair by reason of the perishability of the like or directly competitive agricultural product of an industry; and (3) the serious injury cannot otherwise be prevented by an ITC investigation under normal time periods.  Requires the ITC, if it finds that such criteria have been met, to: (1) find that amount a duty or import restriction on such article which is necessary to prevent or remedy such injury; and (2) give preference to an increase in or imposition of a duty on such imports, if such relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy such injury.  Directs the ITC to report its findings to the President not later than 21 days after such a petition is filed. <p>Requires the President, upon receiving an affirmative finding from the ITC, to provide emergency import relief for such industry, unless within seven days it is determined that provision of such relief is not in the national economic interest of the United States.  Requires the President, if appropriate to provide such relief and in order to prevent the serious and irreparable injury or threat thereof, to: (1) proclaim specified import relief; and/or (2) order the suspension of the liquidation of articles subject to such an affirmative finding that are entered or withdrawn from the warehouse after the date of such finding, and order the posting of a cash bond for the entry of such articles.

Provides that such time limits may be waived by the petitioner requesting relief.  Requires the USTR to submit semiannually a report to the Congress describing the commercial effects of actions to enforce such agreements or to respond to such unfair practices.  Allows the President to take action on his own motion to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements or respond to foreign trade practices.

Requires the administering authority, if it cannot determine the foreign market value of goods exported from a country with a State-controlled economy, to determine the foreign market value of such goods on the basis of the price at which comparable goods are sold at arm's length in the United States by the eligible market economy country with the lowest import price into the United States.  Permits the administering authority, if the volume of imports from such eligible market economy country is insufficient to determine the foreign market value of such goods, to include additional eligible market economy countries in its determination of foreign market vlaue.  Permits the administering authority, if it determines that the prices of the eligible market economy country with the lowest import price do not accurately reflect fair value, if such prices cannot be adequately ascertained or adjusted, or if there is no eligible market economy country, to determine foreign market value of goods on the basis of either another eligible market economy country, or the constructed value of comparable goods in any country or countries other than a nonmarket economy country. Sets forth provisions relating to the administering authority's access to public information with respect to determining import prices. <p>Defines ""eligible market economy country"" to mean a foreign country which is not a nonmarket economy country, in which comparable merchandise is produced for export to the United States, and which the administering authority determines is appropriate for use in calculating foreign market value, taking into account specified factors.

Requires the ITC, if the administering authority has made a preliminary determination as to whether a subsidy is being paid, to commence an investigation of injury as if such preliminary determination was made on the effective date of the injury requirement.  Requires the ITC to make: (1) its preliminary determination of injury not later than 45 days after it receives notification from the administering authority that U.S. obligations require such determination; and (2) its final determination not later than 120 days after such notification. <p>Declares that the lawfulness of acts of importation into, or sale in, the United States of articles that infringe a valid U.S. patent, copyright, trademark, mask work, or trade secret shall be determined without regard to whether such acts have the effect of destroying, substantially injuring, or preventing the establishment of a U.S. industry.

Provides that a petition for eligibility for import relief for the purpose of facilitating orderly adjustment to import competition may be filed with the International Trade Commission (ITC) by any entity which is representative of an industry.  Requires the petition to include a statement describing the specific purposes for which import relief is being sought. <p>Requires the ITC to begin an investigation to determine whether an article is being imported in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, to a competing domestic industry upon:  (1) request of the President or the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR); (2) resolution of specified congressional committees; or (3) filing of a petition.  Requires the ITC, in making such determination, to consider all relevant economic factors.  Lists certain factors to be considered, including, with respect to serious injury, the inability of a significant number of firms to operate domestic production facilities at a reasonable profit and, with respect to threat of serious injury:  (1) export targeting by a foreign government; (2) the existence of affirmative antidumping or countervailing duty determinations relating to a specified country; (3) the extent of the inability of the domestic industry to maintain its research and development expenditures; and (4) the extent to which articles are being diverted to the United States because of export or import restraints in a third country. <p>Sets forth the methods to be used by the ITC to determine the relevant domestic industry, including requiring the ITC to treat as part of an industry only its domestic production even if the industry also imports. <p>Defines ""substantial cause"" to mean a cause which is important and not less than any other cause. <p>Requires the ITC to:  (1) investigate and report on efforts made by firms and workers in the industry to compete more effectively; and (2) investigate any factors which may be contributing to increased imports and, if the ITC has reason to believe that the increased imports are attributable to dumping, to notify the appropriate agency. <p>Declares that imports of competitive articles by domestic producers shall not be considered a factor indicating the absence of serious injury or threat of serious injury to such industry. <p>Requires the ITC to examine factors other than imports which may be a cause of injury or threat of injury to the domestic industry. <p>Requires the ITC to hold public hearings in import relief investigations. <p>Requires the ITC to make a determination within 150 days of the start of an import relief investigation.  Prohibits an import relief investigation with respect to a domestic industry which during the preceding ten years was the subject of a previous investigation that resulted in:  (1) tariff changes, import quotas, or orderly marketing agreements; or (2) the granting of an antitrust exemption to such domestic industry.  Prohibits for one year any import relief investigation, except for good cause, of the same subject matter as a previous investigation that did not succeed in obtaining relief. <p>Requires the President to impose provisional import relief if the President finds that critical circumstances exist.  Sets forth limitations on the duration of such relief.  Declares that critical circumstances exist if a significant increase in imports over a short period of time has led to circumstances in which a delay in the imposition of relief would cause damage to the domestic industry that would be difficult to remedy under the regular import relief procedure. <p>Permits a petition which alleges import injury to a perishable product to be filed with the Secretary of Agriculture with a request that emergency relief be granted.

Requires such group to be established whenever the ITC begins any import relief investigation.  Requires each plan development group to consist of officials from various Federal agencies and individuals who are representative of the firms and of the workers  in the domestic industry.  Requires each plan development group to prepare for the industry concerned an assessment of current problems and a competitiveness enhancement strategy that sets forth objectives and steps that workers and firms could undertake to:  (1) improve the industry's competitiveness; (2) assist the industry to adjust to new methods of competition; (3) lead to a domestic industry that can compete after the expiration of any import relief actions; and (4) adjust to import competition through the orderly transfer of resources to alternative uses.  Sets forth information to be included in such assessment and strategy.  Requires the report on such assessment and strategy to be submitted to the ITC and to the petitioner, if any, within 120 days after the ITC starts the import relief investigation. <p>Requires a petitioner for import relief to file an adjustment plan with the ITC within seven days (later if authorized by the ITC) of the ITC finding that import relief is warranted.  Authorizes any trade association, firm, union, or group of workers that represents a significant portion of the affected domestic industry to file such an adjustment plan with the ITC if the import relief action was not initiated by petition.  Requires the ITC to select one plan if more than one adjustment plan is submitted.  Requires the adjustment plan to set forth: (1) the specific objectives of the import relief being requested (including the facilitation of orderly transfer of resources to alternative uses or other means of adjusting to competition); (2) a schedule for achieving such objectives; and (3) a description of actions which will be taken to achieve such objectives.  Sets forth factors that may be addressed in such adjustment plan.

Requires such a country to have made a commitment to:  (1) eliminate its export subsidies within one year (for countries that are not least developed countries), and for least developed countries, within five years on all other products; and (2) not increase, extend, or add export subsidies.  Requires the United States to reserve the right to terminate ""country under Agreement"" status if a country fails to honor any terms of specified trade agreements. <p>Directs the administering authority to review and publish the status of, and compliance with, specified trade agreements at least once during each 12-month period.  Imposes penalties for failure of a foreign country to honor any term of such agreements, including withdrawing designation of a country as a ""country under the Agreement,"" suspension of liquidation of imports, and initiation of a countervailing duty investigation. <p>Directs the administering authority, if there is an affirmative determination based upon allegations in a petition for relief of the existence of a subsidy which requires the imposition of a countervailing duty, and the petition alleges that the subsidy is inconsistent with the Agreement, or if the administering authority initiates a countervailing duty investigation and the administering authority has reason to believe that a subsidy is inconsistent with the Agreement, to:  (1) notify the U.S. Customs Service and direct customs officials to collect and forward to the administering authority information on the imports of the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation; (2) order the suspension of liquidation of all entries of such merchandise; and (3) begin monitoring the volume of imports of such merchandise to determine whether the volume has significantly increased.  Prohibits making any determination on whether the volume of such imports has significantly increased until 60 days after the date the investigation began.  Terminates any suspension of liquidation of such imports if the administering authority makes a preliminary determination that a subsidy does not exist. <p>Directs the administering authority to order the posting of security for, and the application of a suspension of liquidation to, unliquidated imports which were imported 90 days before the date on which the preliminary determination is published if there is a determination that the volume of imports has surged, the alleged subsidy is inconsistent with the Agreement, and there have been massive imports of the merchandise subject to the countervailing duty investigation in a relatively short period. <p>Directs the administering authority to terminate any suspension of liquidation of imports and to release any posted security requirement if a countervailing duty investigation is terminated. <p>Requires the final determination of the administering authority in a countervailing duty investigation, if there is a final determination that a subsidy exists and if there is a finding that the volume of the investigated imports has increased significantly, to contain a finding on whether the alleged subsidy is inconsistent with the Agreement and whether there have been massive imports of the merchandise being investigated over a relatively short period of time.  (Such finding is a finding of critical circumstances.) <p>Requires the final determination of the International Trade Commission (ITC), if such determination is that there is no material injury but that there is a threat of material injury, to include a finding as to whether material injury by reason of subsidized imports would have been found but for any suspension of liquidation of such imports.  Removes the provision requiring the ITC to include in its final determination findings as to whether there is material injury which will be difficult to repair and whether the material injury was caused by massive imports of subsidized merchandise over a relatively short period of time. <p>Requires the administering authority, if the administering authority makes a final determination that critical circumstances do not exist or if the ITC determines that there is no material injury but that there is a threat of material injury or that the establishment of a U.S. industry is materially retarded, to:  (1) terminate any suspension of liquidation of imports ordered under a countervailing duty investigation; and (2) release any security and refund any cash deposit required with respect to such imports. <p>Permits determinations of whether critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of articles that are not duty-free. <p>Directs the administering authority, if the preliminary determination in an antidumping investigation is affirmative or if the investigation is initiated by the administering authority, to:  (1) notify the U.S. Customs Service of such determination and direct customs officers to collect and forward information on the volume and value of imports of the merchandise subject to such investigation; and (2) begin monitoring the volume of such imports to determine whether the volume of such imports has significantly increased.  Requires the administering authority to publish notice of a determination that the volume of such imports has significantly increased.  Prohibits making such a determination until 60 days after the antidumping investigation has begun.  Directs the administering authority to order the suspension of liquidation of all imports of the articles subject to the antidumping investigation 70 days after the date the investigation has begun.  Terminates such suspension of liquidation if the preliminary determination under waiver of verification is negative. <p>Directs the administering authority to determine whether critical circumstances exist if the administering authority determines that the volume of imports of the articles under investigation for dumping has significantly increased.  (Current law requires the administering authority to determine whether critical circumstances exist if the petitioner alleges critical circumstances.)  Requires the administering authority, if it determines that critical circumstances exist, to order the posting of security for, and require any suspension of liquidation to apply to, unliquidated entries of merchandise imported on or after the date that is 90 days before the date on which the affirmative preliminary determination is published. <p>Terminates any suspension of liquidation of imports and releases any posted security if an antidumping investigation is terminated. <p>Requires the final determination of the administering authority in an antidumping investigation, if it finds that the merchandise subject to the investigation is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value and the administering authority has found that the volume of imports of such merchandise has increased significantly, to contain a finding as to whether: (1) either there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of such merchandise or the importer knew or should have known that the exporter was selling such merchandise at less than its fair value; and (2) there have been massive imports of such merchandise over a relatively short period.  (Current law requires such a finding to be included in the final determination if such critical circumstances have been alleged in the petition for relief.) <p>Requires the final determination of the ITC, if such determination is that there is no material injury but that there is a threat of material injury, to include a finding as to whether material injury by reason of dumped imports would have been found but for any suspension of liquidation of such imports. <p>Requires the administering authority, if the administering authority makes a specified final determination or the ITC determines that there is no material injury but that there is a threat of material injury or that the establishment of a U.S. industry is materially retarded, to:  (1) terminate any suspension of liquidation of imports of such merchandise; and (2) release any security and refund any cash deposit required with respect to such imports. <p>Adds new conditions for the waiver of deposit of estimated antidumping duties.  Authorizes such waiver if in addition to the current requirements:  (1) the investigation has not been designated as extraordinarily complicated; (2) the final determination has not been postponed; (3) credible evidence is presented that the amount by which the foreign market value of the merchandise exceeds the U.S. price is significantly less than the amount of such excess specified in the antidumping duty order; and (4) the data concerning the foreign market value and the U.S. price apply to sales in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and the number of such sales are sufficient to form an adequate basis for comparison.  Requires the administering authority, before determining to allow such waiver, to:  (1) make all confidential information supplied to the administering authority available under a protective order to all interested parties; and (2) afford all interested parties an opportunity to comment on whether the waiver should be permitted. <p>Requires the administering authority, if it determines that merchandise is imported into the customs territory of the United States by, or for the account of, a manufacturer, producer, seller, or exporter for the purpose absorbing antidumping duties imposed on behalf of a U.S. purchaser, to declare such importation a sham transaction and to direct customs officers to treat the U.S. purchaser as the importer of record solely liable for the payment of such duties. <p>Includes within the definition of domestic subsidy (and therefore subject to countervailing duties) the provision of capital, loans, or loan guarantees at preferential rates and the provision of goods or services on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. <p>Requires the ITC, in determining whether material injury occurred in an antidumping or countervailing duty case, to assess cumulatively the volume and effect of imports from two or more countries of like products if such imports compete with like products of the domestic industry in the U.S.  market and if such imports:  (1) are subject to any countervailing or antidumping duty; or (2) during the preceding 12 months were subjected to a final order, suspension agreement, or quantitative restraint resulting from such an investigation. <p>Adds to the factors that the ITC must consider in determining whether threat of material injury exists:  (1) evidence of export targeting by a foreign government; (2) the extent to which the United States is a focal point for exports because of market barriers in third countries; and (3) in dumping cases, dumping findings in other countries against the same exporter. Requires the ITC in such dumping cases to request information from the foreign exporter or U.S. importer on threat of material injury.  Authorizes the ITC to draw adverse inferences if such information is not produced. <p>Imposes special rules for determination of the existence or threat of material injury involving fungible products. <p>Defines ""diversionary input dumping"" to mean any material or component which is incorporated into merchandise that is under investigation, is the subject of an antidumping duty order or a quantitative limitation agreement, and is purchased by a manufacturer or producer of such merchandise at a price that is less than the foreign market value of such material or component. <p>Sets forth various circumstances under which the administering authority shall investigate whether diversionary input dumping is occurring.  Sets forth the method of determining the foreign market value of merchandise and materials and components that are the subject of a diversionary input dumping investigation. <p>Provides that merchandise imported by, or for the use of, a U.S. agency is not exempt from the imposition of countervailing duties or antidumping duties.  Requires such duties to be taken into account in the award of procurement contracts. <p>Includes subsidies provided under the authority of a statute, regulation, policy, or practice of a customs union within the definition of upstream subsidies. <p>Requires an exporter's sales price to be adjusted by being reduced by the amount, if any, of commissions for or reasonable profits incurred in selling merchandise in the United States.  Requires, under specified conditions, the exporter's sales price to be the transaction value of the merchandise, as determined by specified factors. <p>Prohibits the administering authority from deducting indirect selling expenses from foreign market value in order to offset expenses deducted from the exporter's sales price. <p>Authorizes any domestic producer of an article that is like a ""component part"" or a ""downstream product"" to petition the administering authority to designate a downstream product for monitoring. Defines ""component part"" to mean an import that:  (1) during the five years preceding the petition has been subject to certain countervailing or antidumping duty order or agreement; and (2) is used routinely as a major part in other manufactured articles.  Defines ""downstream product"" to mean any import into which is incorporated any component part.  Sets forth information to be included in the petition. <p>Requires the administering authority, within 14 days of receiving the petition, to determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that imports of the downstream product will increase as an indirect result of any diversion of such component parts.  Sets forth factors to be considered in making such determination.  Requires the administering authority to notify the ITC if such determination is affirmative.  Requires the ITC to begin monitoring the levels of trade in downstream products.  Requires the ITC to make quarterly reports based on such monitoring.  Requires the administering authority to:  (1) consider the reports in determining whether to initiate an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation on any downstream product; and (2) request the ITC to stop monitoring such product if the reports indicate that imports are not increasing and there is no reasonable likelihood of diversionary dumping of component parts.",,,,,,
