to Affordable Health Care</b> - <b>Subtitle A:  Increased Availability and Continuity of Health Coverage for Individuals and Their Families</b> - <b>Part 1:  Required Coverage Options for Eligible Employees, Spouses, and Dependents</b> - Requires each employer to make available to each eligible employee a group health plan under which: (1) coverage of each eligible individual with respect to such employee may be elected on an annual basis; (2) coverage is provided for at least the required coverage specified; and (3) employees may elect to have premiums collected through payroll deduction.  Does not require employer contributions to the cost of coverage under such a plan. <p>Provides for the exclusion of:  (1) employers who have been employers for less than two years or who have no more than two eligible employees or no more than two eligible employees not covered under any group health plan; and (2) family members under specified circumstances.  Specifies that a group health plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this Act solely because a period of service by an eligible employee of not more than 60 days is required for coverage. <p>Specifies that the required coverage is standard coverage, except that in the case of a small employer that has not contributed during the previous plan year to the cost of coverage for any eligible employee under any group health plan, the required coverage for the plan year is coverage under a MedAccess standard, MedAccess catastrophic, and MedAccess medisave plan.  Requires standard coverage to include at least one option, either a fee-for-service option and if available, a point-of-service option and a managed care option. <p>Provides for a five-year transition for existing group health plans. <p>Part 2:  <b>Portability and Nondiscrimination</b> - Prohibits a group health plan from imposing (and an insurer from requiring an employer from imposing through a waiting period for coverage under a plan or similar requirement) a limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to treatment of a preexisting condition if:  (1) the condition relates to a condition that was not diagnosed or treated within three months before the date of coverage under the plan; (2) the limitation or exclusion extends over more than six months after the date of coverage, applies to an individual who, as of the date of birth, was covered under the plan, or relates to pregnancy; or (3) an eligible individual has such coverage at the time the individual first became eligible.  Specifies that, in the case of an individual who is eligible for coverage under a plan but for a waiting period imposed by the employer, the individual shall be treated as having been covered under the plan as of the earliest date of the beginning of the waiting period.  Provides a one-time amnesty period for pre-existing condition exclusions. <p>(Sec. 1012) Requires each group health plan to waive any period applicable to a preexisting condition for similar benefits with respect to an individual to the extent that the individual, prior to enrollment in such plan, was covered for the condition under any other health plan. <p>(Sec. 1013) Prohibits:  (1) a multiemployer plan and an exempted multiple employer health plan from canceling or denying renewal of coverage under such a plan for an employer other than for nonpayment of contributions, fraud or other misrepresentation, noncompliance with plan provisions, or because the plan is ceasing to provide any coverage in a geographic area; (2) an insurer from canceling a health insurance plan or denying renewal of coverage other than as prescribed above; and (3) an insurer who terminates the offering of health insurance plans in an area from offering such a plan to any employer in the area until five years after the date of the termination. <p><b>Part 3:  Standards for Managed Care Arrangements and Essential Community Providers</b> - Sets forth requirements for group health plans and insurers that provide health care coverage through managed care arrangements.  Requires such arrangements to assure that covered individuals have reasonably prompt access through the entity's provider network to the benefits package and to centers of excellence. <p>(Sec. 1022) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to establish standards for utilization review programs and periodically review and update such standards to reflect changes in the delivery of health care services. <p><b>Part 4:  Enforcement; Effective Dates; Definitions</b> - Makes provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 applicable with respect to enforcement of this Act (by the Department of Labor). <p>Amends the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to impose a tax ($100 per day for each individual involved, subject to specified limitations) on the failure of an insurer to comply with the requirements under part 2, unless the Secretary determines that the State has in effect a regulatory enforcement mechanism that provides adequate sanctions. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Reform of Health Insurance</b> - <b>Part I:  Marketplace for Small Business</b> - Requires each insurer that makes available a health insurance plan to a small employer in a State to make available to each small employer in the State a MedAccess standard, MedAccess catastrophic, and MedAccess medisave plan, with exceptions for health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and if a State provides for guaranteed availability (rather than guaranteed issue). <p>Requires each insurer that offers a MedAccess plan to a small employer in a State to accept:  (1) every small employer in the State that applies for coverage; and (2) every eligible individual who applies for enrollment on a timely basis.  Sets forth provisions regarding:  (1) special rules for HMOs; (2) timely enrollment requirements; and (3) enrollment of spouses and dependents.  Makes such requirements inapplicable in a State that has provided (in accordance with specified standards) a mechanism under which each insurer offering a health insurance plan to a small employer in the State must participate in a program for assigning high-risk small employer groups (or individuals within such a group) among some or all such insurers, if the insurers comply. <p>(Sec. 1102) Defines ""MedAccess coverage"" as a health insurance plan that:  (1) is designed to provide standard coverage with substantial cost-sharing, only catastrophic coverage, or medisave coverage; (2) includes only essential and medically necessary services; (3) meets applicable requirements relating to guaranteed issue; and (4) meets specifies consumer protection standards.  Defines ""MedAccess standard coverage,"" ""MedAccess catastrophic coverage,"" and ""MedAccess medisave coverage"" to mean a MedAccess plan that provides for at least standard coverage, for only catastrophic coverage, or medisave coverage, respectively. <p>Requests the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to submit to the Secretary a set of rules which is sufficient for determining the actuarial value of coverage offered by a plan. Directs the Secretary to certify such set of rules for use under this subtitle if they meet such requirements or establish such a set of rules. <p>Specifies that a health insurance plan is considered to provide: (1) standard coverage if the benefits are determined, in accordance with certified rules of actuarial equivalence, to have a value that is within five percentage points of an established target actuarial value for standard coverage; (2) catastrophic coverage if benefits are available under the plan for a year only to the extent that expenses for covered services in a year exceed a deductible amount that is consistent with a specified requirement for a catastrophic health plan under the Code, and are determined, in accordance with certified actuarial equivalence rules, to have a value that is within five percentage points of an established target actuarial value for catastrophic coverage; and (3) medisave coverage if such plan consists of a catastrophic health plan within the meaning of the Code and a medical savings account.  Requests NAIC to submit to the Secretary target actuarial values for standard and catastrophic coverage. <p>Permits NAIC to submit periodic revisions of, and permits the Secretary to revise, the set of rules of actuarial equivalence and target actuarial values where necessary to take into account changes in the relevant types of health benefits provisions, in deductible levels for catastrophic coverage, or in relevant demographic conditions. <p>(Sec. 1103) Directs the Secretary to request NAIC to develop model regulations that specify standards with respect to requirements:  (1) that insurers make available MedAccess plans; (2) of guaranteed availability of MedAccess plans to small employers; (3) relating to limits on premiums and certain consumer protections; and (4) relating to limitation of annual premium increases.  Requires the Secretary to review such standards and, if NAIC fails to specify standards meeting such requirements, to promulgate standards.  Sets forth provisions regarding:  (1) the application of MedAccess standards and consumer protection standards by the States; and (2) the Federal role. <p>(Sec. 1104) Sets forth provisions:  (1) regarding limits on premium rate variations, including discounts for employer wellness programs; and (2) requiring an insurer, at the time of offering a health insurance plan to a small employer, to fully disclose rating practices for health insurance plans, including rating practices for different populations and benefit designs. <p>(Sec. 1105) Requires the Secretary of Labor to monitor the prevalence and impact of adverse risk selection in the full insured plans made available to small employers resulting from the decision of small employers to self-insure. <p>(Sec. 1106) Directs the Secretary to:  (1) request NAIC to develop models for reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms for health insurance plans made available to small employers for whom an insurer is at risk of incurring high costs under the plan; and (2) review such models or specify models.  Sets forth provisions regarding implementation of reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms by the States and the Federal role. <p><b>Part 2:  Marketplace for Individuals</b> - Makes the provisions of Part 1 applicable to insurers offering health insurance coverage to individuals and their dependents. <p><b>Part 3:  Voluntary Health Purchasing Arrangements</b> - Provides for the establishment of voluntary health purchasing arrangements. <p>(Sec. 1124) Requires such arrangements to offer enrollment in health insurance coverage only to:  (1) all eligible employees employed by small employers in a service area; and (2) all eligible individuals residing in such area. <p><b>Part 4:  Definitions and Miscellaneous Provisions</b> - Provides definitions for purposes of this subtitle. <p>(Sec. 1134) Requires the Secretary to make annual reports to the Congress on the implementation of this subtitle and the need for additional reforms to assure and expand coverage. <p>(Sec. 1135) Authorizes the Director to conduct:  (1) research on the impact of this subtitle on the availability of affordable health coverage for employees and dependents in the small employers group health care coverage market and other specified topics; and (2) demonstration projects relating to such topics.  Requires the Director to develop:  (1) methods for measuring the relative health risks of eligible individuals in terms of the expected costs of providing benefits under health insurance plans and, in particular, MedAccess plans; and (2) a model for equitably distributing health risks among insurers in the small employer health care coverage market.  Authorizes appropriations. <p><b>Subtitle C:  Preemption</b> - <b>Part 1:  Scope of State Regulation</b> - Makes inapplicable to a group health plan any State or local law requiring coverage of specific benefits, services, or categories of health care, or services of any class or type of provider of health care. <p>(Sec. 1202) Makes inapplicable any State or local law prohibiting two or more employers from obtaining coverage under a multiple employer welfare arrangement under which all coverage:  (1) consists of medical care described under specified provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA); and (2) is fully insured. <p>(Sec. 1203) Preempts, for a five-year period, State law provisions which restrict:  (1) reimbursement rates or selective contracting; (2) differential financing incentives; and (3) utilization review methods.  Directs the Comptroller General to study benefits and cost effectiveness of use of managed care in health services delivery and to report to the Congress, including recommendations as to whether such preemption should be extended. <p><b>Part 2:  Multiple Employer Health Benefits Protections</b> - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to provide a limited exemption from certain restrictions on ERISA preemption of State law for health plans maintained by multiple employers subject to certain Federal standards. <p>Relieves such exempted multiple employer health plans of certain restrictions on preemption of State law, and treats them as employee welfare benefit plans. <p>Sets forth exemption procedures, application and eligibility requirements, and additional notice, reporting, and actuarial requirements applicable to exempted multiple employer health plans. <p>Requires multiple employer welfare arrangements providing certain medical care benefits to issue specified disclosures to participating employers. <p>Requires each multiple employer welfare arrangement which is or has been an exempted multiple employer health plan, and under which coverage is not fully insured, to establish certain minimum reserves.

Provides that BARs shall not address or affect liability concerning damages to natural resources. <p>Provides for the initiation of a BAR by the filing of a petition with the EPA Office of Administrative Law Judges by the Administrator or a State where the site is located. <p>Exempts de micromis parties (parties that a panel determines contributed only 100 pounds or liters of material containing hazardous substances at the facility or such amount as determined by the Administrator) from liability to the United States or to any other person for response actions or for past, present, or future costs incurred at the site. <p>Requires final BARs to be issued within 18 months of the publication of a notice of petition (or 24 months for cases of exceptional complexity).  Bases the assigned share of liability on specified allocation factors, including the ability to pay.  Requires the Administrator to make firm offers of settlement to all de minimis parties (parties that contributed only one percent or less of the total quantity of hazardous substances present at the site).  Makes a BAR decision binding as to all past, present, and future liability for response costs and for contributions in civil proceedings. <p>Permits judicial review of final BAR decisions. <p>Sets forth procedures for recovery by creditor parties. <p>Provides for stays of certain pending enforcement actions and private party litigation until a BAR is issued. <p>Authorizes any group of PRPs to submit a private allocation for the NPL site, to be known as a ""voluntary binding allocation of responsibility,"" to the allocation panel. <p>Provides that a BAR shall constitute a permanent determination of the assigned share of a liable party and of the orphan share and, except for specified additions to the orphan share and judicially mandated changes, shall not be subject to any change for at least five years after the date of final decision.  Permits a new BAR only if the request demonstrates that due to new information not reasonably available during the first BAR, a 35 percent or greater increase in total waste-in volume has been discovered. <p>(Sec. 111) Exempts qualified redevelopers from liability for costs or damages with respect to hazardous substance releases. <p>(Sec. 112) Extends a current exemption from liability for response action contractors under Federal law to State and local law and expands the activities considered to be response actions. <p>Excludes such contractors from the definition of ""owner or operator"" for purposes of limiting liability. <p>Provides a limitation on actions against response action contractors. <p><b>Title II:  State Implementation</b> - Authorizes States to apply to the Administrator to carry out response actions and enforcement activities at all facilities listed or proposed for listing on the NPL. Grants a State such authority if it possesses the legal authority, technical capability, and resources necessary to conduct response actions in a manner consistent with this Act.  Makes such States eligible for response action financing from the Fund and the Retroactive Liability Fund.  Requires States to pay ten percent of the costs of all response actions for which the State receives funds from the Fund.  Makes such cost-sharing requirement inapplicable to States that receive funds from the Retroactive Liability Fund. <p>(Sec. 201) Authorizes a State to select a response action that achieves a level of cleanup that is more stringent than required if it agrees to pay for the incremental increase in response cost attributable to achieving the more stringent level. <p>(Sec. 203) Directs the President to:  (1) maintain records of the costs incurred in connection with any oversight contract or arrangement for remedial investigations or feasibility studies; and (2) establish an administrative procedure under which a party that conducts a response action may contest the costs incurred in such oversight. Requires oversight costs exceeding 50 percent of the response costs incurred by the responsible party to be paid by the Fund. <p><b>Title III:  Remedy Selection</b> - Authorizes the President or an authorized State to take immediate risk reduction measures whenever a release poses an imminent and substantial danger to public health. Prohibits the President or a State from instituting long-term remediation measures.  Authorizes the use of the Fund for such measures, but permits the President to recover costs from liable parties as well. <p>(Sec. 302) Applies the hazard ranking system to a site or facility only after the site or facility has undergone immediate risk reduction measures.  Applies such requirement to sites and facilities to be newly listed on the NPL and to any sites already listed for which remedial investigation and feasibility studies have not been conducted. <p>(Sec. 303) Directs the President or a State, as appropriate, to prepare a long-term response plan for an affected facility.  Authorizes PRPs to prepare and carry out certain elements of such plan.

Care</b> - <b>Subtitle A:  Increased Availability and Continuity of Health Coverage for Employees and Their Families</b> - <b>Part 1:  Required Coverage Options for Eligible Employees, Spouses, and Dependents</b> - Requires each employer to make available to each eligible employee a group health plan under which:  (1) coverage of each eligible individual with respect to such employee may be elected on an annual basis; (2) coverage is provided for at least the required coverage specified; and (3) employees may elect to have premiums collected through payroll deduction.  Does not require employer contributions to the cost of coverage under such a plan. <p>Provides for the exclusion of:  (1) employers who have been employers for less than two years or who have no more than two eligible employees or no more than two eligible employees not covered under any group health plan; and (2) family members under specified circumstances.  Specifies that a group health plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this Act solely because a period of service by an eligible employee of not more than 60 days is required for coverage. <p>Specifies that the required coverage is standard coverage, except that in the case of a small employer that has not contributed during the previous plan year to the cost of coverage for any eligible employee under any group health plan, the required coverage for the plan year is coverage under a MedAccess standard, MedAccess catastrophic, and MedAccess medisave plan. <p>Provides for a five-year transition for existing group health plans. <p>(Sec. 1002) Sets forth provisions regarding:  (1) compliance with applicable requirements through multiple employer health arrangements; and (2) coverage options under a State medical health allowance program. <p><b>Part 2:  Preexisting Conditions and Continuity of Coverage; Renewability</b> - Prohibits a group health plan from imposing (and an insurer from requiring an employer from imposing through a waiting period for coverage under a plan or similar requirement) a limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to treatment of a preexisting condition if:  (1) the condition relates to a condition that was not diagnosed or treated within three months before the date of coverage under the plan; or (2) the limitation or exclusion extends over more than six month after the date of coverage, applies to an individual who, as of the date of birth, was covered under the plan, or relates to pregnancy. Specifies that, in the case of an individual who is eligible for coverage under a plan but for a waiting period imposed by the employer, the individual shall be treated as having been covered under the plan as of the earliest date of the beginning of the waiting period. <p>(Sec. 1012) Requires each group health plan to waive any period applicable to a preexisting condition for similar benefits with respect to an individual to the extent that the individual, prior to enrollment in such plan, was covered for the condition under any other health plan. <p>(Sec. 1013) Prohibits:  (1) a multiemployer plan and an exempted multiple employer health plan from canceling or denying renewal of coverage under such a plan for an employer other than for nonpayment of contributions, fraud or other misrepresentation, noncompliance with plan provisions, or misuse of a provider network provision, or because the plan is ceasing to provide any coverage in a geographic area; (2) an insurer from canceling a health insurance plan or denying renewal of coverage other than as prescribed above; and (3) an insurer who terminates the offering of health insurance plans in an area from offering such a plan to any employer in the area until five years after the date of the termination. <p><b>Part 3:  Enforcement; Effective Dates; Definitions</b> - Makes provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 applicable with respect to enforcement of this Act (by the Department of Labor). <p>Amends the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to impose a tax ($100 per day for each individual involved, subject to specified limitations) on the failure of an insurer to comply with the requirements under part 2 unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) determines that the State has in effect a regulatory enforcement mechanism that provides adequate sanctions. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Reform of Health Insurance Marketplace for Small Business</b> - Requires each insurer that makes available a health insurance plan to a small employer in a State to make available to each small employer in the State a MedAccess standard, MedAccess catastrophic, and MedAccess medisave plan, with exceptions for health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and if a State provides for guaranteed availability (rather than guaranteed issue). <p>Requires each insurer that offers a MedAccess plan to a small employer in a State to accept:  (1) every small employer in the State that applies for coverage; and (2) every eligible individual who applies for enrollment on a timely basis. Sets forth provision regarding:  (1) special rules for HMOs; (2) timely enrollment requirements; and (3) enrollment of spouses and dependents. Makes such requirements inapplicable in a State that has provided (in accordance with specified standards) a mechanism under which each insurer offering a health insurance plan to a small employer in the State must participate in a program for assigning high-risk small employer groups (or individuals within such a group) among some or all such insurers, if the insurers comply. <p>(Sec. 1102) Defines ""MedAccess plan"" as a health insurance plan that:  (1) is designed to provide standard coverage with substantial cost-sharing, only catastrophic coverage, or medisave coverage; (2) includes only essential and medically necessary services; (3) meets applicable requirements relating to guaranteed issue; and (4) meets specifies consumer protection standards.  Defines ""MedAccess standard plan,"" ""MedAccess catastrophic plan,"" and ""MedAccess medisave plan"" to mean a MedAccess plan that provides for at least standard coverage, for only catastrophic coverage, or medisave coverage, respectively. <p>Requests the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to submit to the Secretary a set of rules which NAIC determines is sufficient for determining, in the case of any health insurance plan and for purposes of this subtitle, the actuarial value of the coverage offered by the plan.  Directs the Secretary to certify such set of rules for use under this subtitle if they meet such requirements or establish such a set of rules. <p>Specifies that a health insurance plan is considered to provide: (1) standard coverage if the benefits are determined, in accordance with certified rules of actuarial equivalence, to have a value that is within five percentage points of an established target actuarial value for standard coverage; (2) catastrophic coverage if benefits are available under the plan for a year only to the extent that expenses for covered services in a year exceed a deductible amount that is consistent with a specified requirement for a catastrophic health plan under the Code, and are determined, in accordance with certified actuarial equivalence rules, to have a value that is within five percentage points of an established target actuarial value for catastrophic coverage; and (3) medisave coverage if such plan consists of a catastrophic health plan within the meaning of the Code and a medical savings account. Requests NAIC to submit to the Secretary target actuarial values for standard and catastrophic coverage. <p>Permits NAIC to submit periodic revisions of, and permits the Secretary to revise, the set of rules of actuarial equivalence and target actuarial values where necessary to take into account changes in the relevant types of health benefits provisions, in deductible levels for catastrophic coverage, or in relevant demographic conditions. <p>(Sec. 1103) Directs the Secretary to request NAIC to develop model regulations that specify standards with respect to requirements:  (1) that insurers make available MedAccess plans; (2) of guaranteed availability of MedAccess plans to small employers; (3) relating to limits on premiums and certain consumer protections; and (4) relating to limitation of annual premium increases.  Requires the Secretary to review such standards and, if NAIC fails to specify standards meeting such requirements, to promulgate standards.  Sets forth provisions regarding:  (1) the application of MedAccess standards and consumer protection standards by the States; and (2) the Federal role. <p>(Sec. 1104) Sets forth provisions:  (1) regarding limits on premiums and annual premium increases; and (2) requiring an insurer, at the time of offering a health insurance plan to a small employer, to fully disclose rating practices for health insurance plans, including rating practices for different populations and benefit designs. <p>(Sec. 1106) Directs the Secretary to:  (1) request NAIC to develop models for reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms for health insurance plans made available to small employers for whom an insurer is at risk of incurring high costs under the plan; and (2) review such models or specify models. Sets forth provisions regarding implementation of reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms by the States and the Federal role. Amends the Code to provide for the imposition of a tax on any health insurance plan which covers any employee in a Federal reinsurance State. <p>(Sec. 1108) Directs the Secretary to establish an Office of Private Health Care Coverage.  Requires the Office Director to submit to the Congress annual reports evaluating health care coverage reform. <p>(Sec. 1109) Authorizes the Director to conduct:  (1) research on the impact of this subtitle on the availability of affordable health coverage for employees and dependents in the small employers group health care coverage market and other specified topics; and (2) demonstration projects relating to such topics.  Requires the Director to develop:  (1) methods for measuring the relative health risks of eligible individuals in terms of the expected costs of providing benefits under health insurance plans and, in particular, MedAccess plans; and (2) a model for equitably distributing health risks among insurers in the small employer health care coverage market.  Authorizes appropriations. <p><b>Subtitle C:  Preemption</b> - <b>Part 1:  Scope of State Regulation</b> - Prohibits:  (1) State benefit mandates for group health plans; and (2) State or local law prohibitions against two or more employers obtaining coverage under an insured multiple employer health plan. <p>(Sec. 1203) Preempts State restrictions concerning:  (1) reimbursement rates or selective contracting; (2) differential financial incentives; and (3) utilization review methods.  Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study of the benefits and cost effectiveness of the use of managed care in the delivery of health services. <p><b>Part 2:  Multiple Employer Health Benefits Protections</b> - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to allow a limited exemption under preemption rules for multiple employer plans providing health benefits subject to certain Federal standards. <p>(Sec. 1212) Relieves exempted multiple employer plans providing medical care benefits of certain restrictions on preemption of State law.  Treats such plans as employee welfare benefit plans.  Allows commencement of new arrangements only if such exemption is in effect or an application is pending and the Secretary of Labor determines that provisional protection is appropriate. <p>Sets forth exemption procedures, eligibility requirements, and additional requirements applicable to exempted arrangements.  Requires certain disclosures to participating employers, maintenance of reserves, and corrective actions.  Provides for expiration, suspension, and revocation of exemptions, and for review of actions by the Secretary. <p>(Sec. 1213) Revises provisions relating to scope of preemption rules, and to treatment of single employer arrangements and of certain collectively bargained arrangements. <p>(Sec. 1215) Establishes special rules for employee leasing healthcare arrangements.  Treats such arrangements as multiple employer welfare arrangements except when they are multiple employer health plans. <p>(Sec. 1216) Sets forth enforcement provisions relating to multiple employer welfare arrangements and employee leasing health care arrangements. <p>(Sec. 1217) Sets forth filing requirements for multiple employer welfare arrangements. <p>(Sec. 1218) Provides for cooperation between Federal and State authorities in enforcing ERISA requirements for multiple employer welfare arrangements with the limited exemption. <p><b>Part 3:  Encouragement of Multiple Employer Arrangements Providing Basic Health Benefits</b> - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate the commonality of interest or geographic location requirement for tax exempt trust status for multiple employer health plans and insured multiple employer health plans if they meet certain requirements under ERISA and this Act. <p><b>Part 4:  Simplifying Filing of Reports for Employers Covered under Insured Multiple Employer Health Plans</b> - Amends ERISA to direct the Secretary of Labor to prescribe an alternative method providing for a single annual report with respect to all employers who are covered under the same insured multiple employer health plan. <p><b>Part 5:  Compliance with Coverage Option Requirements</b> - Provides for compliance with applicable coverage requirements through multiemployer plans and other multiple employer health arrangements. <p><b>Subtitle D:  Health Deduction Fairness</b> - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide:  (1) for a permanent extension and increase in the health insurance tax deduction for self-employed individuals; and (2) that the deduction for certain health insurance costs be determined without regard to an adjusted gross income threshold.  Disallows the deduction to individuals eligible for employer-subsidized coverage.
