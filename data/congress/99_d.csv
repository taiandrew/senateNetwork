Requires the Council to make recommendations to the Secretary concerning the administration of continuing care services under titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act and as such services are affected by title I of this Act. <p>Amends part A (Hospital Insurance) of the Medicare program to require the Secretary to establish medical claims standards which are to be applied uniformly and take into account a patient's medical profile, condition, and other practical considerations in determining the medical reasonableness and necessity of claims for continuing care services (defined to include extended care and home health services).  Requires the Secretary to annually review and, if necessary, revise the standards. <p>Authorizes a fiscal intermediary which has initially determined that some or all of a continuing care services claim may be denied, but has not yet officially denied the claim, to consult with the service provider, patient, and patient's physician to review the determination and approve a modified claim if the services are appropriate and the patient concurs in the modification. <p>Directs the Secretary, in determining whether payments to home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities should be denied, to continue certain presumptions of compliance with reasonable and necessary services requirements until a system providing for case-by-case determinations of authorizations for continuing care services is implemented.  Requires system implementation within 30 months of enactment of this Act. <p>Requires a fiscal intermediary to reimburse a provider of continuing care for services provided to an individual for whom there was reasonable evidence of entitlement if the provider makes a timely request that the intermediary determine whether the individual is entitled to such services. <p>Sets forth deadlines by which fiscal intermediaries must respond to provider inquiries concerning the medical necessity of continuing care services.  Requires intermediaries to reimburse providers for medically unnecessary services provided over periods during which the intermediary's response is past due. <p>Indemnifies beneficiaries who pay providers for continuing care services without knowing that they are unqualified for such services or that such services are medically unnecessary.

Authorizes provider appeals on behalf of beneficiaries.  Provides that, when a fiscal intermediary denies payment for continuing care services or a provider first furnishes such services, such organizations must inform beneficiaries regarding the individual's rights under this Act to appeal payment determinations. <p>Amends part B (Peer Review) of title XI of the Act to require peer review organizations, in certain situations to be determined by the Secretary, to perform independent medical reviews of fiscal intermediary denials of payment for continuing care services.  Requires each peer review organization to annually report to the Secretary regarding such reviews.  Directs peer review organizations to authorize payment for services which would not otherwise meet payment conditions where such organization certifies that exceptional circumstances exist to justify the cost-effective provision of the services. <p>Amends part A (Hospital Insurance) of the Medicare program to require the Secretary to establish performance standards for fiscal intermediary medical claims review which: (1) weigh the accuracy and timeliness of such review commensurately with cost savings from such review; (2) specify the qualifications required of review personnel; and (3) require an intensive level of review for new providers and providers with poor performance records.  Requires the Secretary to annually inform the Continuing Care Policy Council regarding the intermediaries' performance under these standards. <p>Eliminates the three-day prior hospitalization requirement for extended care services. <p>Defines part-time or intermittent home health care to include one or more daily visits by a nurse or home health aide for up to 60 days, but thereafter requires a physician's certification of need for such daily services. Set limits on Medicare payments for home health services, but requires that such limits be applied on an aggregate rather than a discipline-specific basis for home health agencies.  Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take all current cost data into account when computing costs to which payment limits are applied. <p>Requires that Medicare regulations be open to public notice and comment to the same extent to which rulemaking is subject to such procedures by the Administrative Procedure Act. <p>Directs the Secretary to establish a Medicare benefits management demonstration program, including projects which:  (1) substitute, for the process of submitting separate claims by providers for an individual beneficiary, a single benefits manager that would identify and track the benefits most appropriate to the beneficiary; and (2) provide additional benefits to Medicare beneficiaries, including noncovered benefits if no additional costs are thereby imposed on beneficiaries or Medicare. <p><b>Title II:  Quality Assurance Reforms</b> - Amends part B (Peer Review) of title XI of the Act to establish a National Council on Quality Assurance.  Directs the Director of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment to provide for the appointment of members of the Council.

Requires the USTR, in making such estimate, to take into account the international competitiveness of the goods or services involved. <p>Requires the USTR, within 90 days of submitting the annual report on trade barriers to the Congress, to establish export goals for the next three years for certain foreign countries which have trade barriers to a significant portion of possible U.S. exports and which deny market access to those U.S. exports that are less able to petition for relief. Requires the President, if the export goal for a country is not met, to take all necessary actions to reduce the exports of that country to the United States by a specified amount. Requires the President to report to the Congress annually on such actions. <p>Transfers from the President to the USTR the authority to:  (1) determine whether U.S. action is appropriate to enforce U.S. rights under a trade agreement or to respond to certain foreign trade practices; (2) determine the appropriate additional import relief in such cases; and (3) determine any additional restrictions on service sector access authorizations.  Transfers from the President to the USTR the authority to take action on the USTR's own motion. <p>Includes among the foreign trade practices that may trigger a U.S. response any act, policy, or practice that threatens to burden or restrict U.S. commerce.  Sets forth a list of foreign acts, policies, and practices which burden U.S. commerce. <p>Authorizes the USTR, in response to certain foreign trade practices, to:  (1) enter into binding agreements that fully offset the burden on U.S. commerce of such practices; or (2) withdraw, or refrain from proclaiming, eligibility of a foreign country for preferential treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences. <p>Includes within the meaning of unreasonable foreign trade acts, policies, or practices any combination of unfair foreign trade acts, policies, or practices and any such acts, practices, or procedures that deny: (1) market opportunities (including protection of an industry in its formative stages); (2) opportunities for the establishment of an enterprise; (3) protection of intellectual property rights; or (4) protection against anti-competitive practices. <p>Includes within the definition of ""service sector access authorization"" any authorization that gives access to the U.S. market to a foreign supplier of goods related to a service. <p>Directs the USTR, in determining whether to initiate an investigation of foreign trade practices, to consider the ability of the persons affected by such practices to prepare a petition for such an investigation. <p>Directs the USTR to determine, within 90 days of the start of such an investigation, whether:  (1) the United States is being denied its rights under any trade agreement; or (2) there is any unfair trade act, policy, or practice. Sets forth the actions to be taken by the USTR based on such determination. Requires an import relief action to terminate after seven years if it has existed continuously for seven years and no request to extend the action is made during the last 60 days of such seven-year period.  Requires the USTR to review the effectiveness of such an import action if a request to extend the import relief is made. <p>Authorizes the President, if such import relief involves raising tariffs or imposing import restrictions, to negotiate a trade agreement providing compensation, or to proclaim tariff changes to provide compensation for certain countries in order to meet U.S. international obligations. <p><b>Title II:  Support for United States Exports - Subtitle A:  Export Financing</b> - Amends the Trade and Development Enhancement Act of 1983 to declare that one of the purposes of such Act is to establish a temporary tied aid credit program to combat the predatory concessional credit programs of foreign governments. <p>Directs the President to negotiate limits on partially untied aid credit. Changes the U.S. negotiating objectives to include references to partially untied aid credits. <p>Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish within the Department of the Treasury a program of tied aid credits for U.S. exports.  Requires the program to be carried out in cooperation with the Export-Import Bank or with private financial institutions or entities.  (Currently the program is established within the Export-Import Bank and carried out in cooperation with the Agency for International Development (AID).)  Sets forth financing methods that may be included in such program.  Sets forth factors the Secretary of the Treasury shall consider in determining whether to provide financing with respect to a particular country or firm.

Defines ""partially untied aid credit.""  Deletes references to government-mixed credits and public-private cofinancing. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Foreign Trade Practices</b> - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to make it unlawful for any U.S. person, in order to receive help in obtaining business with a foreign government or entity, corruptly to offer money or anything of value to a foreign official or a foreign political party, candidate, or party official.  Prohibits a U.S. person from acting in U.S. interstate or foreign commerce with knowledge that a third party will make such an offer for such a purpose.  Exempts from such prohibitions:  (1) any payment made to expedite, or secure the performance of, a routine governmental action, other than an action to award business to a U.S. person; or (2) any payment which is permitted under the law of the country involved.  Directs the Secretary of Commerce to issue guidelines and procedures for compliance with this Act.  Requires the Secretary of Commerce to establish a procedure to provide responses to specific inquiries concerning compliance with this subtitle.

Directs the President to report to the Congress within one year of enactment of this Act on those negotiations and other possible actions. <p><b>Subtitle C:  Miscellaneous Provisions</b> - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to study and report to the Congress on:  (1) U.S. laws that hamper U.S. ability to export goods and services; and (2) an estimate of the increase in exports if each such law were amended to promote exports. <p>Requires each Federal agency, before taking any major action that may affect international trade, to prepare and publish a report on the potential impact of such action on U.S. international trade and on the ability of U.S. firms to compete in foreign markets. <p>Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to monitor, and study the potential impact of, legislation which may affect U.S. international trade and the ability of U.S. firms to compete in foreign markets. <p>Expresses the sense of the Congress that:  (1) each U.S. Executive Director of a multilateral development bank should take specified actions to promote procurement opportunities for U.S. firms; and (2) a Foreign Commercial Officer should be assigned to each such Director to help promote such opportunities. <p>Requires the Export-Import Bank to negotiate agreements with State agencies that promote exports which will establish procedures to ensure consultation and coordination:  (1) between the Export-Import Bank and such State agencies; and (2) among such State agencies.  Requires the Export-Import Bank and the Secretary of Commerce to ensure that such State agencies have access to the trade information system developed under title IX of this Act. <p>Directs the Secretaries of State and Commerce to review periodically the number of personnel assigned to U.S. missions abroad to determine whether an adequate number of such personnel are engaged in economic or commercial duties to aid U.S. exporters and businesses doing business outside the United States.  Declares that the Secretaries should extend the length of assignment of such personnel in order to ensure greater continuity in promoting U.S. exports. <p>Requires each chief of a U.S. mission to a country that is an important trading partner and which has significant potential for U.S. export sales to report annually to the President and the Congress on:  (1) the strategy used by such mission to expand U.S. exports; and (2) the efforts of such mission to assist U.S. industries in expanding export sales and in improving their market position. <p><b>Title III:  Economic Growth and Trade Expansion</b> - Directs the President to initiate negotiations with foreign countries in order to:  (1) coordinate macroeconomic adjustments; (2) base their economic growth on a balance of foreign and domestic demand; and (3) ensure that such foreign countries pursue a pro-growth strategy to resolve the international debt crisis. <p><b>Title IV:  Maintenance and Development of Agricultural Export Markets</b> - Authorizes appropriations for research that would enhance the long-term competitiveness in world markets of U.S. agricultural commodities. <p>Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to monitor research and trade practices carried out by foreign countries to promote the export of agricultural commodities and to report annually to the Congress concerning:  (1) trends in the comparative position of U.S. and foreign exports of farm commodities; (2) new research developments that may affect the competitiveness of U.S. farm commodities; (3) the level of U.S. and foreign subsidies provided to promote agricultural exports; and (4) the marketing in nonmarket economies of U.S. farm commodities. <p>Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to provide farm commodities acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation to improve the quality of grain exported from the United States. <p>Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report annually to the Congress on the impact of actions of the USTR on the export of U.S. farm commodities. <p><b>Title V:  Relief from Injury Caused by Import Competition</b> - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to allow one of the purposes of an import relief petition to be the desire to enhance competitiveness. <p>Includes among the economic factors to be considered in determining whether increased imports constitute a serious injury to a domestic industry the inability of a significant number of firms to operate domestic production facilities at a reasonable profit. <p>Adds to the factors to be considered in import relief investigations relating to whether increased imports are a threat of serious injury to a domestic industry:  (1) any combination of coordinated government actions that are bestowed on a specified enterprise the effect of which is to increase the competitiveness of that enterprise and that cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry concerned; (2) the existence of an affirmative antidumping or countervailing duty determination; (3) the extent to which firms in the domestic  industry concerned are unable to maintain existing levels of research and development expenses; and (4) the extent to which the U.S. market is the focal point for diversion of exports because of a foreign country's market restraints. <p>Requires the International Trade Commission (ITC), in determining what domestic industry is affected by imports, to treat as part of the domestic industry only the domestic production of a domestic producer who also imports. <p>Prohibits considering imports of like or directly competitive articles by domestic producers as a factor indicating the absence of serious injury or threat of serious injury to a domestic industry. <p>Requires the ITC, in an import relief investigation, to consider factors other than imports which may cause injury or threaten injury to a domestic industry and to report on such factors to the President. <p>Permits the ITC to recommend both increases in import restrictions and adjustment assistance if the ITC finds that increased imports are causing a serious injury or threat of serious injury to a domestic industry. Requires the ITC to prepare for the President an estimate of the short-term and long-term effects of such increases in import duties or import restrictions on private and industrial consumers. <p>Directs the President to impose provisional import relief if critical circumstances exist (circumstances caused by a significant increase in imports over a short period of time in which a delay in the imposition of relief would cause damage to the domestic industry that would be difficult to remedy under the usual import relief measures). <p>Authorizes filing a petition with the Secretary of Agriculture for emergency import relief in addition to any petition filed with the ITC if the petition relates to imports of perishable products.   Requires the Secretary to make a recommendation to the President within 14 days of receiving such petition on whether or not to take emergency action.  Requires the Secretary to recommend emergency relief if the Secretary finds that emergency action is warranted and that increased imports of a perishable product are a substantial cause of serious injury or threat of serious injury to the competing domestic industry. Requires the President to decide, within seven days of receiving such recommendation, what, if any, import restrictions to impose on such imports.  Provides for the termination of such emergency relief. <p>Requires the ITC to evaluate the effectiveness of import relief actions and to report on such evaluation to the President and the Congress. <p>Requires the USTR to establish a plan development group for an industry after the ITC begins an import relief investigation based upon a petition filed by firms, a union, or a group of workers that represent a significant portion of the domestic industry if the petitioners request the establishment of such a plan development group.  Requires each such group (made up of government and private sector representatives)  to prepare an assessment of current problems in the industry and a strategy to enhance its competitiveness.  Sets forth information to be included in such assessment and strategy.  Requires the assessment and strategy to be submitted, along with the opinions of the members of the plan development group on the viability of such strategy, to the petitioner within 120 days of the start of an ITC import relief investigation.  Authorizes the petitioner, if the ITC finds that imports have caused serious injury to the domestic industry, to submit the assessment and strategy to the ITC on the day after the ITC makes such finding.  Requires the USTR to present to the ITC some of the opinions of Federal agencies on the viability of such strategy.  Requires the ITC, upon submission of such assessment and strategy to the petitioner and before the ITC evaluates what effect such a strategy will have on the domestic industry, to try to obtain confidential commitments from the individual members of the domestic industry on their future actions.  Requires the ITC to transmit such commitments to certain members of the Government to enable them to evaluate the assessment and strategy.  Requires the President under certain circumstances to consider such confidential commitments, assessment and strategy, and recommendations of the interagency trade organization.  Sets forth the actions the ITC must take if the ITC finds that increased imports are a substantial cause of or constitute a threat of serious injury to a domestic industry and if an adjustment assessment and strategy have been submitted. <p>Directs the President, in determining whether to provide import relief, to take into account the probable effectiveness of import relief as a means of promoting adjustment or modernization in order to improve competitive abilities. <p>Directs the President, if the President has received an assessment and strategy in connection with an injured or threatened industry, to:  (1) provide the import relief found necessary by the ITC; (2) provide substantially equivalent import relief; or (3) submit to the Congress a draft of a bill making certain waivers and containing provisions implementing the import relief, if any, that the President has decided to take.  Provides for expedited congressional consideration of such a bill.  Requires the President to implement the import relief found necessary by the ITC if after 90 days such bill is not enacted. <p>Provides for publication of the assessment and strategy if import relief is provided.  Requires a review committee to:  (1) monitor actions taken by petitioners to improve the competitive position of the industry; (2) make recommendations for administrative actions to achieve the objectives of the assessment and strategy; and (3) submit to the Congress legislative  recommendations.  Provides for expedited consideration of legislative recommendations. <p>Requires the review committee to consult with members of the plan development group and with members of the domestic industry if the objectives and actions specified in the assessment and strategy are not being implemented or if the confidential commitments are not being kept.  Authorizes the President to terminate or modify the import relief if, after the consultations, the review committee determines that such failure to implement the strategy or commitments is not justified by changed circumstances and has adversely affected overall implementation of the objectives set forth in the assessment and strategy. <p>Directs the President, before deciding whether to grant import relief, to consult with the interagency trade organization established pursuant to the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and consider the recommendations of such organization. <p>Changes the import relief actions available to the President.  Authorizes the President to proclaim a change in any ""auctioned quantitative restriction"" on imports of an article.  (Current law refers to a ""quantitative restriction"" of imports.) Deletes the provision authorizing the President to negotiate orderly marketing agreements with foreign countries in order to provide import relief. <p>Includes among the import relief actions available to the President the right to:  (1) initiate on an accelerated basis an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation; or (2) enter into multilateral negotiations to address problems not susceptible to unilateral solution. <p>Permits an import relief investigation into imports of an article that received import relief less than two years before the start of the new investigation if good cause is shown. <p>Sets forth the procedure for an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation which the President orders as a form of import relief. <p>Directs the President to impose import restrictions or increase import duties if multilateral negotiations ordered by the President as a form of import relief fail to provide relief from serious injury or the threat of serious injury within one year.  Provides for expedited consideration of legislation implementing such import restrictions or import duty increases. <p>Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue import licenses in order to enforce certain quantitative limitations on imports.  Requires such licenses to be auctioned to the highest bidder. <p>Requires the ITC to review an injury determination and its recommendations relating to the determination if:  (1) the ITC has made a unanimous affirmative injury determination; (2) the President declined between January 1, 1984, and October 1, 1985, to prevent or remedy the injury or threat of injury found by the ITC; and (3) a petition for review is filed within one year of enactment of this Act.  Requires the ITC, within 60 days of receiving such petition, to:  (1) determine whether the injury should be reaffirmed or revoked; and (2) if the injury determination is reaffirmed, report such determination to the President and set forth the increase in import duty or the import restriction necessary to prevent the injury or threat of injury.  Requires the ITC to publish such report. Requires the President to decide whether to impose such import relief within 30 days of receiving such report. <p><b>Title VI:  Resistance to Predatory Trade Practices</b> - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to develop criteria for identifying foreign industries that are engaging in predatory competition against U.S. industries.  Requires the Secretary of Commerce to monitor and report to the Congress semiannually on:  (1) the identity of each such foreign industry; and (2) the aggregate volume of, and rate of, U.S. sales of each such foreign industry. <p>Requires the Secretary of Commerce to submit to the Congress notice of excessive increase in the sales of a product of a predatory foreign industry. Defines excessive increase in sales to mean an increase more than ten percent greater than the sales rate that would be expected based on the product's sales rate during the preceding three years.  Provides for expedited congressional consideration of legislation to impose or increase the duty on such a product. <p>Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to declare that the unauthorized importation (or sale) of articles into the United States that infringe a valid U.S. patent, copyright, trademark, U.S. maskwork, or trade secret is unfair and has the effect of destroying or substantially injuring a U.S. industry or impairing the establishment of such industry.  Permits any person to petition the ITC for the issuance of an order to exclude such articles, during its investigation, from entry into the United States.  Sets forth:  (1) civil penalties for violations under this Act; and (2) procedures for the modification or recission of an ITC order under this Act. <p>Repeals a specified section of the Tariff Act of 1930 relating to the importation of products produced under a process covered by claims of unexpired patent. <p>Process Patent Amendment of 1986 - Amends the patent laws to make it an infringement of patent to use, sell, or import into the United States without authority a product produced by a patented process. <p>Directs the Department of Commerce to report to the Congress annually for five years on the effect such restriction has on the importation of ingredients for U.S. manufacturing. <p>Expresses the sense of the Congress that the amount of funds appropriated to the Customs Service should be sufficient to provide enough personnel to enforce the customs laws. <p>Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to include in the definition of ""subsidy"" (for antidumping and countervailing duty purposes) any resource input subsidy. States that a ""resource input subsidy"" is found to exist if:  (1) (a) a product is provided or sold by a government-regulated or controlled entity within a country for input use within such country at a domestic price that is lower than the fair market value of the input product and is not freely available to U.S. producers; and (b) a product would, if sold at the fair market value, constitute a significant portion of the total cost of the manufacture or production of the merchandise in or for which the input product is used; or (2) under specified circumstances, the right to remove or extract such product is provided or sold by a government or a government-regulated or controlled entity within a country.  Sets forth the method of calculation for the amount of a resource input subsidy. <p>Defines ""fair market value"" and ""input use."" <p>Requires injury determinations by the ITC to be made in all countervailing duty investigations relating to the existence of resource input subsidies. <p><b>Title VII:  International Trade Negotiations</b> - Directs the USTR to request the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to join the United States in ministerial sessions preparatory to a new round of negotiations.  Sets forth the goals of such sessions, including:  (1) strengthening GATT articles in certain areas and strengthening the GATT as an institution; and (2) tightening GATT enforcement measures. <p><b>Title VIII:  International Debt Crisis</b> - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, the USTR, and the Federal Reserve Board to study and report to the Congress on the options for improving the international debt crisis and on the consequences of flexibility in repayment of international debt under certain conditions. <p>Expresses the sense of the Congress that a satisfactory resolution of the debt crisis and a resumption of economic growth in the developing world require that:  (1) the products of debtor countries have reasonable access to the markets of industrialized countries; and (2) industrialized countries benefitting from U.S. defense provide greater financial commitment to the international organizations aiding debtor countries. <p>Directs the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Agriculture to study the feasibility of implementing a Cooley Loan Program and to develop a list of those less developed countries in which Cooley Loan Program activities might be conducted.

Requires a plan to be designed in a manner so as to provide, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that:  (1) the amount of the total revenues per discharge for all hospitals in the State for each year beginning before 1987 in which the plan is in effect may not exceed the base general hospital revenues per discharge increased by the sum of the compounded sum of the percentage limits for a year and the previous years for which the State plan was in effect, and the population-discharge factor;  and (2) the amount of the total revenues per discharge for all services furnished to hospital inpatients for all hospitals in the State for each year beginning after 1986 in which the plan is in effect may not exceed the sum of the base general hospital revenues per discharge increased by the sum of the compounded sum of the percentage limits for a year and the previous years for which the State plan was in effect, and the population-discharge factor, plus the base physician-related hospital revenues per discharge increased by the sum of the compounded sum of the percentage limits for a year and the previous years for which the plan is in effect and provided for a limitation under this clause (2), and the population-discharge factor.  Authorizes a State, at its option, to apply the test specified in clause (2) instead of the test specified in clause (1) with respect to years prior to 1986. <p>Permits a plan, instead of meeting the above requirements, to meet such other alternative test of constraint of health care costs as the Secretary determines will not result in a greater expenditure of funds under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act and by private payers than would have been made if the plan met the above requirements. <p>Requires a plan to be designed so as to provide that the amount of revenues for inpatient hospital services and physicians' services to hospital inpatients and individuals entitled to benefits under parts A (Hospital Insurance) and B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII of the Social Security Act may not exceed the amount which would otherwise be payable (including copayments and deductibles) for such services under title XVIII.  Permits a plan (other than a plan providing for the establishment of rates of hospital reimbursement for hospital inpatient services) to provide that payment under title XVIII for inpatient hospital services and for other services furnished to hospital inpatients shall continue to be made in the amounts and in the manner otherwise provided under Medicare. <p>Requires that the unreimbursed costs incurred by hospitals in providing services to low-income, uninsured or underinsured patients (other than Medicare or Medicaid patients) be paid pursuant to a plan in an amount which must, in the aggregate, be the same proportion of total revenues as such unreimbursed costs are of total costs of patients who are neither Medicare nor Medicaid patients.  Provides that such unreimbursed costs shall be paid through distribution of funds pooled at the statewide level, through a higher payment rate, or through another method approved by the Secretary. <p>Requires a plan to have a mechanism for providing fair hearings for hospitals and any other entities aggrieved by determinations made under the plan. <p>Requires a State to provide for the appointment of a panel, consisting of members with expertise in health care economics and service delivery, to advise in the development and implementation of its plan, periodically review and propose modifications to the plan, and establish the methodology for establishing the percentage limit used to compute hospital revenues.  Requires such methodology to include the use of appropriate external price indicators, the use of data from major collective-bargaining agreements for nonsupervisory hospital employees, and other appropriate indicators of wage costs.  Requires the methodology to be approved by the Secretary. <p>Requires a plan, to the extent that it provides for meeting plan requirements through a system which provides for the establishment of rates for hospital reimbursement for hospital inpatient services by an entity other than the hospital, to meet the following additional requirements:  (1) except as provided in clause (2), the plan must provide equitable treatment of all entities that pay for health services covered under the plan, of hospital employees, and of patients;  (2) if the plan is established under State law, the plan must take into account the proportion of costs associated with, and services covered by, the different payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, and may not permit undue shifting of proportions of costs among the different payors;  (3) the plan may not make available any discount in price to any purchaser unless the discount accurately reflects economic benefits to a hospital resulting from a service arrangement with a purchaser and the discount is made available to all other purchasers who can satisfy such service;  and (4) the plan must provide a procedure whereby, upon the request of a hospital, an adjustment can be considered to the rate limitation applicable under the plan to that hospital to reflect a significant change in the inpatient hospital services, increased costs for the compensation of employees, funds necessary to provide for the efficient operation of a hospital which the State has determined should remain in operation, and higher expenses associated with a regional tertiary care institution, teaching hospital, or children's hospital. <p>Directs the Secretary, in reviewing a plan which provides for control of hospital inpatient costs through a competitive mechanism, to take into account the degree to which the plan provides for the following or other measures to improve price competition among providers:  (1) the plan provides for open enrollment periods;  (2) the plan provides for the dissemination of information concerning different health benefits plans;  (3) the plan encourages innovation and public incentives to new forms of health care delivery and financing;  (4) there are negotiated prices and risk-sharing between insurers and health care providers;  and (5) the laws of the State do not impose legal barriers to competition in negotiated and other arrangements among insurers and health care providers. <p>Sets forth part B of title XXI entitled ""Residual Federal Program, subpart I, Transition Period."" Provides that, subject to the provisions of subpart I, for any accounting period of a hospital subject to subpart I, the total revenues for inpatient hospital services may not exceed the total of such revenues that are permitted on the basis of prospective payment limits established under subpart I for the hospital's discharges as classified by diagnosis-related groups. <p>Requires each hospital subject to a limitation on revenues under subpart I to provide for the publication of a price list which establishes the price per discharge which any payor may pay for inpatient hospital services. Requires a hospital to submit its price list to the Secretary. <p>Directs the Secretary to determine (for each accounting period) a prospective payment limit for inpatient hospital services for discharges classified by diagnosis-related groups.  Sets forth the method for determining and adjusting the limit for each hospital for discharges. <p>Authorizes the Secretary, at the request of a hospital, to increase the allowable revenues for an accounting period or provide for an increase in the base number of discharges otherwise permitted under subpart I to allow for higher revenues than would otherwise be permitted if:  (1) a major renovation or replacement of physical plant or significant change in the capacity of the hospital has occurred;  (2) the hospital is a sole community provider or provides a disproportionate percentage of its services to low-income or Medicare patients, the hospital would otherwise be insolvent, and the State has determined that the hospital should remain open;  (3) a larger revenue increase is needed because the hospital is a regional tertiary care institution, teaching hospital, or children's hospital;  and (4) there has been a significant change in the characteristics of the hospital's mix of patients. <p>Subjects a hospital which has total inpatient revenues for an accounting period in excess of its applicable limit to a civil penalty, unless the excess is deposited in an escrow account.  Permits withdrawals from the account upon the Secretary's certification that the total inpatient revenues of a hospital for an accounting period fall below the applicable limit for that period.  Establishes a civil penalty for a physician or other person or entity (other than a hospital) who has charged any person or entity for services which are required by law to be billed to a hospital.  Sets forth provisions relating to notice, opportunity for a hearing, and appeal of such penalties. <p>Prohibits a hospital from engaging in an admission practice that results in:  (1) a refusal to admit a patient who is unable to pay for inpatient hospital services; (2) the refusal to admit a patient who would be expected to require unusually costly or prolonged treatment;  or (3) the refusal to provide emergency services to any person in need of such services.  Sets forth penalties, including exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid participation, for hospitals committing such admissions violations. <p>Sets forth subpart II of Part B entitled ""Post-Transition Period.""  Provides that in the case of a State not having a plan approved under part A and in effect for any period beginning after the transition period, the Secretary shall establish and implement a health care plan for such State for such period which meets the requirements of part A, with specified differences. <p>Sets forth definitions under part C of title XXI. <p>Establishes an Advisory Committee on Health Care Technologies and Procedures.  Directs the Advisory Committee to examine the appropriateness of the various interventions and the conditions under which they are needed, the safety and efficacy of alternative therapeutic and preventive regimens, and the standards for availability and utilization of various technologies, and to publicly report on whether or not payments should be made for such services and, if so, under what conditions and frequency of service. <p>Exempts individuals enrolled in health maintenance organizations and competitive medical plans from the limits established under title XXI on revenues and discharge of a hospital if:  (1) the organization elects such treatment;  or (2) the organization annually pays for more than 20 percent of the number of bed-days of care with respect to that hospital. <p>Amends provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to employees' health benefits plans to provide that if an employer makes a contribution with respect to the costs of a health benefits plan of an employee and the employer offers the option of membership in a health maintenance organization or a competitive medical plan, which membership provides benefits at least actuarially equivalent to those provided under the other health benefits plan, the employer shall:  (1) contribute at least as much towards the membership as the maximum amount of the employer's contribution to the other plan;  (2) provide for a cash rebate if the contribution with respect to any other health benefits plan exceeds the cost of membership with the organization;  and (3) provide information to employees that reasonably compares the benefits and costs of different plans.  Exempts from the provisions of the previous sentence employees of an employer represented by a collective bargaining representative or other employee representative selected under any law. <p>Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, with respect to health maintenance organizations and competitive medical plans, to provide that the annual per capita rate of payment for each class of members shall be 100 percent in the case of individuals enrolled with an eligible organization in an area where at least 30 percent of the individuals eligible to enroll with an organization are enrolled. <p>Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to exempt a health maintenance organization which is a public entity from the requirement that at least 75 percent of its membership be Medicaid eligible or insured under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII or under both parts A (Hospital Insurance) and B of title XVIII. <p>Directs the Secretary, under the prospective payment provisions of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, to provide that in the case of a State health care plan approved under Part A of title XXI of the Public Health Service Act payments with respect to services covered under title XXI:  (1) may, at the State's option, be made in accordance with title XXI rather than Medicare;  or (2) shall be made in accordance with title XXI rather than Medicare in the case of a plan which provides for the control of hospital costs through a title XXI rate setting mechanism. <p>Provides for increased Medicare payments to a hospital for its operating costs if the number of admissions for an accounting period exceeds the hospital's admissions during a specified base period. <p>Directs the Secretary to determine a regionally adjusted capital-related prospective payment rate for each inpatient hospital discharge in accordance with a specified formula. <p>Directs the Secretary, for each diagnosis-related group, to estimate the average per discharge amount of charges recognized under part B of title XVIII attributable to items and services furnished to inpatients within such group during 1983.  Provides that, subject to the part B deductible and subject to other provisions of the Medicare prospective payment rate provisions, with respect to each individual entitled to benefits under part A and enrolled under part B of title XVIII who is a hospital inpatient and whose discharge is classified within a diagnosis-related group, the Secretary shall provide for payment to the hospital of an amount equal to 80 percent of a specified rate in lieu of payments otherwise made under part B for inpatient services. <p>Requires that:  (1) payments for health care services furnished to inpatients be made to or through a hospital as a condition of the hospital's participation in the Medicare payment; and (2) the Secretary provide for notice to the public and to individuals enrolled under part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act of such requirement. <p>Permits the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to borrow at any time from other social security trust funds if it can repay the loan within ten years. Provides for the periodic transfer to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund of amounts which the Secretary determines to be equal to a specified fraction of the total revenues of the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for each fiscal year. <p>Directs the Secretary to conduct and report to the Congress on seven studies relating to:  (1) health care costs, quality, delivery, and services;  and (2) the effects of this Act.",,,,,,

Provides for an increasing number of weeks of such benefits as the level of a State's unemployment increases in terms of specified types of unemployment periods. <p>Sets forth provisions for extended benefit periods and benefit tiers.  Provides that an extended benefit period for a State shall begin with the third week after the first week for which there is a State ""on"" indicator, and end with the third week after the first week for which there is a State ""off"" indicator. <p>Provides that there is a State ""on"" indicator for a week if:  (1) the State's insured unemployment rate (IUR) is four percent or greater during the two preceding 13-week periods, or five percent or greater during the one preceding 13-week period, and such preceding 13-week period equals or exceeds a certain average IUR for comparable periods in the prior six years in order to qualify for a benefit tier; or (2) the average of the State's unadjusted total civilian unemployment rate (TUR) is nine percent or greater for the most recent two months immediately preceding such week for which such rate is available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). <p>Provides for a State ""off"" indicator for a week if:  (1) there is not a State ""on"" indicator for such week; (2) such week is a redetermination week; and (3) the State's IUR is less than four percent for the two preceding 13-week periods or fails to qualify for any tier. <p>Provides for initial tier periods for the first six weeks of any extended benefit period, with the State's initial tier to be determined on the basis of the third week preceding the tier period and to remain the same for the six weeks of the initial tier period. <p>Provides for redeterminations and continuing periods.  Requires that, three weeks after the beginning of any tier period, a redetermination be made of whether there is a State ""on"" or ""off"" indicator for such week, and whether the State's tier for such week has changed.  Provides that, if there is not an ""off"" indicator, a new six-week period shall begin with the third week following such week, and the tier shall be determined for such new period. Provides that, if there is an ""off"" indicator, the extended benefit period shall end with the third week following such redetermination. <p>Sets benefit tier levels, for which a State can qualify on the basis of its IUR over the 13-week period ending with the week of determination or redetermination or its TUR over the most recent two months immediately preceding such week for which BLS statistics are available. (Sets forth a special rule under which, under certain conditions, a State not qualifying for such tiers shall be deemed to be at tier I.) Requires, in order to qualify for such tiers, that a State's IUR for the 13-week period also equal or exceed the average of such rate for comparable 13-week periods in the prior six years.  Provides for qualification for lower tiers if the State's IUR equals or exceeds specified percentages of such average, as follows: (1) the next lower tier if 90 percent or greater; (2) the second lower tier if 80 percent or greater; and (3) the third lower tier if 70 percent or greater. <p>Sets forth provisions for an individual's eligibility period for any benefit year.  Makes such period consist of the first week in such benefit year for which the individual meets specified current requirements of the Act and which is in an extended benefits period, and all weeks thereafter in such benefit year for which the individual continues to be unemployed and meets the requirements of the Act.  Provides that, if at the end of such benefit year, the individual is receiving extended compensation and has not exhausted such compensation, the individual's eligibility period shall continue for any subsequent consecutive weeks of unemployment in which the individual meets the requirements of the Act until the individual has exhausted the individual's extended compensation. <p>Defines the ""rate of insured unemployment"" (IUR) as the percentage arrived at by dividing:  (1) the average weekly number of individuals filing claims for regular compensation for weeks of unemployment with respect to a specified period, based on State agency reports, by (2) the average monthly covered employment for the specified period.  Provides that the IUR for any 13-week period shall be determined by reference to the average monthly covered employment under the State law for the first four of the most recent six calendar quarters ending before the close of such period. <p>Revises provisions for payments to States under the Act.  Provides for an increasing Federal share of the State's costs for regular and extended compensation as the State's level of unemployment increases.  Requires such Federal payments to States in an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the sum of the sharable extended compensation and the sharable regular compensation paid to individuals under the State law. Sets forth such applicable percentages. Defines ""sharable regular compensation,"" for purposes of such payments to States, as regular compensation paid to an individual for a week of unemployment in such individual's eligibility period:  (1) to the extent that such amount exceeds 26 times the weekly benefit amount (including dependents' allowances) for weeks of total unemployment payable to such individual under the State law in the benefit year in which such eligibility period begins; and (2) which would qualify as ""sharable extended compensation"" under specified provisions if it were extended compensation. <p>Amends title IX (Employment Security) of the Social Security Act to authorize appropriations for additional amounts to be transferred into the extended unemployment compensation account.  Sets such amounts at the total of:  (1) 80 percent of the amount of Federal payments required to be made to States under this Act with respect to compensation paid during a tier IV period; (2) 60 percent of such amount for tier III; (3) 40 percent of such amount for tier II; and (4) 20 percent of such amount for tier I.  Provides that such appropriations shall not be required to be repaid. <p>Revises the Act to permit the State to modify the requirement that an individual must actively engage in seeking work during each week of unemployment in order to qualify for extended compensation.  Permits States to take into account any State determination that labor market conditions in the labor market area in which such individual last worked and in the labor market area in which such individual resides are so depressed that actively seeking work likely will not result in employment. <p>Prohibits payment of extended unemployment compensation to an individual unless the individual participates in an intensive one-week job search program administered by the Employment Service if requested to so participate. <p>Repeals the Federal Supplemental Compensation Act of 1982. <p>Permits States to choose to delay the applicability of the amendments and repeals made by this Act.  Sets forth transition provisions for such States. <p>Directs the Secretary of Labor to study and report to the Congress, within one year after enactment of this Act, on alternatives to the insured unemployment rate (IUR) which would be available with respect to all States and which might provide a more accurate measurement of the employment and labor market situation in each State. <p>Provides that actions taken by a State to meet any requirement of this Act, or the amendments made by this Act, shall not be considered a State action which results or will result in a net decrease in the solvency of the State unemployment compensation system, for purposes of specified provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act.",,,,,,

States that a claimant has the burden of submitting sufficient evidence to justify his or her claim, and that if an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence exists regarding the merits of a claim, the VA is to resolve such doubt in favor of the claimant. <p>States that VA subpoenas may be served either by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail. <p>Requires the chairman of the Board of Veterans' Appeals to submit an annual report to the appropriate congressional committees concerning the Board's current handling of cases and projections for the subsequent fiscal year. <p>Requires the Board to:  (1) provide notice to a claimant and an opportunity for a hearing before a decision may be based on ""additional official information"" received after a Board decision has previously been made; and (2) make its decision exclusively on evidence and material of record in the proceeding. <p>Removes the requirement that new material sufficient to allow the Board to reopen a previously disallowed claim be in the form of official reports. <p>Provides that the Board's discretionary authority to reopen a claim will not be diminished by a judicial decision following an appeal as provided for by this Act. <p>Requires the Board to mail to the claimant notice of its decision and the reasons for such decision. <p>Provides that, upon the request of a claimant, the Board shall provide an independent advisory medical opinion when there exists substantial medical disagreement with respect to a material issue in a veteran's appeal. <p>Sets forth new procedural rules for adjudication hearings regarding:  (1) oaths, affirmations, and witness examination; (2) admissibility of evidence; (3) procedural rights of claimants; (4) disqualification of a hearing officer; (5) the record of the proceedings and the claimant's right to examine and obtain a copy of such record; and (6) the exclusiveness of veterans' adjudication procedures and rights prescribed by the Administrator. <p>Requires the Administrator to provide at each stage of the appeal proceedings written notice to a claimant of the claimant's procedural rights. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to conduct a study of two alternative claims resolution methods:  one a new intermediate-level adjudication process; the other an enhanced schedule of formal Appeals Board hearings. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on such studies. <p><b>Title II:  Veterans Administration Rule Making</b> - Includes the VA's rulemaking procedures under the relevant provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. <p><b>Title III:  Judicial Review</b> - Provides for judicial review of VA decisions in the Federal court system. <p>States with regard to jurisdiction:  (1) the definition of final decision; (2) that judicial review of a final decision in a claim for benefits may be obtained in a civil action brought within 180 days of the Board's mailing of notice of its decision, and that such action shall be brought in Federal district court; (3) that the VA shall file the various materials constituting the record in a case together with its answer to the claimant's complaint; (4) that the court may render a decision on the pleadings; and (5) that the judicial review procedures established under this Act shall not apply to insurance and home loans. <p>States, with regard to the reviewing court's scope of review, that such court:  (1) shall decide questions of law and interpret constitutional, statutory, and regulatory provisions, but that questions of fact (unless unsupported by substantial evidence) will not be subject to a trial de novo; and (2) in reviewing a final decision of the VA which is adverse to a party solely because such party failed to comply with VA procedures, may only review questions concerning such procedures. <p>Sets out provisions regarding remand, survival of actions, and appellate review. <p><b>Title IV:  Attorneys' Fees</b> - Authorizes the Administrator to allow attorneys' fees above the present $10 maximum if the appealing party's claim is allowed by the VA after an initial denial.  States that such fee shall be the lesser of: (1) the fee agreed upon by the party and attorney; (2) $500, unless the Administrator approves a greater amount; or (3) if the party and attorney have entered into a contingent-fee agreement, not more than 25 percent of the total of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of such party's claim. <p>Provides for the approval of attorneys' fees in successful veterans' claims brought before a court as provided for under this Act. States that such fees shall be determined by such court, and in contingent-fee agreements such fees shall not exceed 25 percent of the total of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of such claim. Authorizes attorneys' fees of up to $750 in certain unsuccessful veterans' claims. <p>Prohibits the VA from authorizing payment to a claimant's attorney based on past-due benefits unless such benefits are owed as of the date of the VA's or a court's award. <p>States that such provisions regarding attorneys' fees shall only apply to claims for benefits under the laws administered by the VA and shall not apply in cases in which the VA is the plaintiff or in which other attorneys' fees statutes are otherwise controlling. <p><b>Title V:  Effective Dates</b> - Sets forth the effective dates for this Act.",,,,,,

Directs the President to:  (1) attempt, through negotiations, to persuade other governments to adopt restrictions on new investment in and bank loans to South Africa; and (2) report annually to the Congress on the status of such negotiations.  Sets forth penalties for violations of such prohibition.  Terminates such prohibition upon enactment of a joint resolution approving a finding by the President that South Africa has made substantial progress toward the full participation of all the people of South Africa in the social, political, and economic life in that country and toward an end to discrimination based on race or ethnic origin. <p><b>Title II:  Labor Standards</b> - Requires any United States person who has or controls an enterprise in South Africa which employs more than 20 people to ensure that in operating such enterprise the following employment principles are implemented:  (1) desegregation in any employment facility; (2) equal employment for all employees; (3) equal pay for equal work; (4) establishment of a minimum wage and salary structure; (5) increase in the representation of nonwhites in managerial, supervisory, administrative, clerical, and technical jobs; (6) improvement of the quality of employees' lives outside the work environment; and (7) recognition of labor unions and fair labor practices.  Declares that the Secretary may issue guidelines and give advisory opinions on compliance with such principles. <p>Directs the Secretary of State (""the Secretary"") to establish an Advisory Council in South Africa to advise the Secretary with respect to the implementation of such employment principles and to review the annual reports which each U.S. person covered by this Act must submit to the Secretary on the progress made in implementing such principles. <p>Directs the Secretary to establish in the United States an American Advisory Council to make policy recommendations regarding labor practices of U.S. persons in South Africa to review such persons' progress in implementing such employment practices. <p>Directs the Secretary:  (1) to take specified actions to ensure compliance with the implementation of such employment principles; and (2) to review the compliance of such persons at least biennially.  Sets forth penalties for noncompliance.  Authorizes the President to waive compliance with the implementation of such principles if such compliance would harm U.S. national security. <p><b>Title III: Prohibition on Loans and Importation of Gold Coins</b> - Prohibits any U.S. bank from making any loan directly or through a foreign subsidiary to South Africa unless such loan is for educational, housing, or health facilities available to all persons on a nondiscriminatory basis.
