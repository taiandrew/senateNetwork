Provides that such term shall include petroleum (including crude oil or any fraction thereof) only in the case of a release from an underground storage tank as defined in title IV of this Act.  Adds references to ""pollutants or contaminants"" under specified provisions of the Act. <p>Includes under the definition of ""release"" the abandonment or discarding of barrels, containers, and other closed receptacles containing hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants. <p>Revises conditions under which the terms ""remedy"" or ""remedial action"" may include offsite transfer, storage, treatment, destruction, or secure disposition.  Requires that such offsite actions must be determined to be at least as cost-effective as other remedial actions.  Requires the President, in making such a determination, to take into account: (1) the long-term uncertainties associated with land disposal; (2) the goals, objectives, and requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act; (3) the persistence, toxicity, mobility, and propensity to bioaccumulate of such hazardous substances; and (4) the long-term maintenance costs of alternative remedial actions. <p>Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (the Administrator) to promulgate regulations establishing reportable quantities for:  (1) all hazardous substances other than carcinogens, within six months after enactment of this Act; and (2) the remaining hazardous substances, by October 1, 1986. <p>Increases the amount of criminal fines and the duration of criminal sentences for specified violations under the Act.  Adds civil penalties for specified violations under the Act. <p>Revises response authorities provisions.  Requires that any removal action undertaken by the Administrator or any other person with respect to any release or threat of release shall contribute to the efficient performance of any long-term remedial action with respect to such release or threatened release. Authorizes the Administrator to undertake any such response action unless the Administrator determines that such action will be done properly by the owner or operator of the facility from which the release or threatened release emanates, or by any other responsible party.  Directs the Administrator, in undertaking any information gathering or planning under such response authority provisions, to assess the potential effects on human health associated with the release or threatened release. <p>Revises response authorities provisions relating to agreements with States. Requires States to make specified agreements with the Administrator, rather than with the President. Eliminates the requirement that a State assure all future maintenance of the removal and remedial actions provided for the expected life of such actions.  Requires the State to pay ten percent of the costs of remedial action and ten percent of all future operation and maintenance costs of any onsite remedial action.  Requires a 50 percent or greater State share of response costs only in the case of facilities operated, as well as owned, by the State or local government at the time of hazardous waste disposal.  Requires the State to also pay all future operation and maintenance costs of any onsite remedial action at such State or locally owned and operated facilities. Provides for credits to any State which has paid more than a ten percent share of remedial costs at a facility owned, but not operated, by such State or local government. Provides that reasonable administrative expenses may be credited against a State's ten percent share.  Provides for credits to a State under prescribed circumstances in which State or local funds are expended. <p>Sets forth mandatory cleanup standards.  Directs the Administrator, rather than the President, to select appropriate cost-effective remedial actions determined to be necessary.  Requires that such actions be in accordance with:  (1) the National Contingency Plan to the extent practicable;  and (2) a required protection level. Directs the Administrator, in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a remedial action, to select (to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with the public health and welfare and the environment) permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies that will result in a permanent and significant decrease in the toxicity, mobility, or volume of the hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant, taking specified factors into account. <p>Requires that the remedial action provide for a level or standard of control necessary to protect human health and the environment.  Requires that such level or standard be as stringent as the most stringent applicable standard under the Toxic Substances Control Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act, or Clean Water Act (or water quality criteria under the Clean Water Act).  Requires that any remedial action which provides for containment at the facility comply with standards applicable to facilities required to obtain hazardous waste management permits under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Authorizes the Administrator to waive the requirement of the most stringent applicable standard, or of the specified containment standard, and to select an alternative remedial action upon a finding that:  (1) such alternative remedial action will provide substantially equivalent protection;  or (2) compliance with such requirements at that facility will consume such a disproportionate share of the resources of the Hazardous Substances Trust Fund (the Fund) as to have the effect of deferring or preventing remedial action at other facilities which pose a significantly greater threat to human health and the environment. <p>Prohibits permit requirements for any removal or remedial action undertaken pursuant to the Act at the location of the release or threatened release. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to establish the exclusive administrative procedures for making any determination under provisions for required protection level. <p>Revises provisions for information gathering and access authorities to refer to the Administrator, rather than the President.  Applies specified information requirements to generators of hazardous wastes, even if such information is available at the facility where such waste is located. Provides for access to such facilities by duly designated Federal and State officers, whenever necessary to carry out any provision of the Act, at reasonable times and for a reasonable duration.  Prohibits anyone from impeding or interfering with such entry. <p>Directs the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to prepare toxicological profiles including specified information, sufficient to establish the likely effect on human health of at least 100 hazardous substances which are most frequently found or which pose the most significant threat to human health at facilities listed on the National Priorities List prepared under the National Contingency Plan.  Requires that the 100 profiles be completed 48 months after enactment of this Act (at 12-month intervals for four groups of 25 substances). <p>Adds new provisions for public participation in remedial action planning. Sets forth requirements and procedures for public notice and opportunity to comment on such plans.  Authorizes the Administrator to make grants available to any group of individuals who may be affected by a release or threatened release at any facility which is listed on the National Priority List under the National Contingency Plan. Provides that such grants shall be for enabling the group to obtain expert advice and technical assistance to review and assess data and information prepared and required to be published by the Administrator with respect to such facility.  Limits such grants to not more than four-fifths of the total costs of such advice and assistance. Requires each grant recipient to contribute at least one-fifth of the total of such costs. Prohibits more than one such grant from being made with respect to a single facility. <p>Sets forth mandatory remedial action schedules. <p>Directs the Administrator (of EPA) to commence remedial investigations for all facilities which are listed, as of the enactment date of this Act, on the National Priorities List (NPL) in accordance with the following schedule:  (1) one-third of such facilities within eight months after such enactment date;  (2) two-thirds within 16 months after such date;  and (3) all within 24 months after such date. <p>Directs the Administrator to list not fewer than 1,600 facilities on the NPL by January 1, 1988.  Directs the Administrator to insure commencement of remedial actions and feasibility studies for each facility added to the NPL after the enactment date of this Act, beginning 24 momths after such enactment date, according to a schedule which provides for such commencement at:  (1) 200 facilities during the first 12 months after such 24-month period; (2) 275 facilities during the next 12 months; and (3) 375 facilities during the third 12 months. <p>Directs the Administrator to ensure that substantial and continuous physical on-site remedial action commences at facilities on the NPL at a rate of not fewer than 150 facilities per year beginning on October 1, 1986. <p>Directs the Administrator to complete by January 1, 1987, preliminary assessments of all sites listed, as of the enactment date of this Act, on the Emergency and Remedial Response Information System. <p>Directs the Administrator to ensure that remedial action is completed, to the maximum extent feasible, for all facilities listed as of the date of enactment of this Act on the NPL within five years after such enactment date.

Provides that if a State transmits to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, within one year of the enactment of this Act, a statement that the State intends to submit a health care plan (described below), for purposes of making payments to the State under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act the Federal medical assistance percentage shall be 102 percent of such percentage as otherwise determined under Medicaid for such State for up to one year. Directs the Secretary to exempt hospitals in a State from the prospective payment limits established under this Act for certain time periods occurring during the first year of the transition period (defined in part C of title XXI as the 24-month period beginning January 1985) if: (1) the State requests such treatment;  (2) the State indicates an intention to have implemented a State plan under title XXI which will provide for a recoupment of any revenues received in excess of the amounts permitted under part A;  and (3) the State has agreed, with respect to such hospitals, that if a State plan under this Act is not implemented by the end of the first year of the transition period, then the Secretary shall provide for such adjustment in the prospective payment limits under part I of part B as will provide for recoupment in the subsequent year of any revenues received in excess of amounts permitted. <p>Authorizes a State to apply to the Secretary for the approval of a health care plan for the State for an initial period of up to three years, subject to disapproval.  Authorizes extensions of such initial period for up to two additional years.  Provides that, for any one year period, in the case of any State with an approved plan:  (1) the transitional period provisions of subpart I of part B of title XXI shall not apply;  (2) requirements for reimbursement (other than those relating to beneficiary cost sharing) under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act shall be waived; and (3) for purposes of making payments to a State under Medicaid the Federal medical assistance percentage shall, for the year the plan is in effect, be 103 percent (or 104 percent in the case of an unrestricted Medicaid plan) of the amount of the Federal medical assistance percentage otherwise determined under Medicaid and 102 percent (or 103 percent in the case of an unrestricted Medicaid plan) for any subsequent year (except for any extension period) of the amount of the Federal medical assistance percentage otherwise determined. Defines ""unrestricted Medicaid plan"" as a State Medicaid plan which does not impose any limitation on the scope or duration of inpatient hospital services other than requiring that such services be medically necessary. Directs the Secretary to annually review each approved plan.  Requires the continued approval, for a certain time, of a plan not in compliance, if the State certifies that it will comply within a stated time period.  Permits a further extension of approval if there is a trend towards compliance.  Provides for the establishment of a Federal program with respect to hospitals for a State which cannot comply. <p>Requires a State plan, in order to be approved, to meet the general requirements set forth below and, if applicable, certain requirements relating to ratesetting plans. Permits a plan, in meeting the general requirements, to be designed in a manner that meets such requirements through a ratesetting system, a voluntary system, or through the use of competitive mechanisms.  Requires a plan to be designed in a manner so as to provide, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that:  (1) the amount of the total revenues per discharge for all hospitals in the State for each year beginning before 1987 in which the plan is in effect may not exceed the base general hospital revenues per discharge increased by the sum of the compounded sum of the percentage limits for a year and the previous years for which the State plan was in effect, and the population-discharge factor;  and (2) the amount of the total revenues per discharge for all services furnished to hospitals inpatients for all hospitals in the State for each year beginning after 1986 in which the plan is in effect may not exceed the sum of the base general hospital revenues per discharge increased by the sum of the compounded sum of the percentage limits for a year and the previous years for which the State plan was in effect, and the population-discharge factor, plus the base physician-related hospital revenues per discharge increased by the sum of the compounded sum of the percentage limits for a year and the previous years for which the plan is in effect and provided for a limitation under this clause (2), and the population-discharge factor.  Authorizes a State, at its option, to apply the test specified in clause (2) instead of the test specified in clause (1) with respect to years prior to 1986. <p>Permits a plan, instead of meeting the above requirements, to meet such other alternative test of constraint of health care costs as the Secretary determines will not result in a greater expenditure of funds under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act and by private payers than would have been made if the plan met the above requirements. <p>Requires a plan to be designed so as to provide that the amount of revenues for inpatient hospital services and physicians' services to hospital inpatients and individuals entitled to benefits under parts A (Hospital Insurance) and B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII of the Social Security Act may not exceed the amount which would otherwise be payable (including copayments and deductibles) for such services under title XVIII.  Permits a plan (other than a plan providing for the establishment of rates of hospital reimbursement for hospital inpatient services) to provide that payment under title XVIII for inpatient hospital services and for other services furnished to hospital inpatients shall continue to be made in the amounts and in the manner otherwise provided under Medicare. <p>Requires that the unreimbursed costs incurred by hospitals in providing services to low-income, uninsured, or underinsured patients (other than Medicare or Medicaid patients) be paid pursuant to a plan in an amount which must, in the aggregate, be the same proportion of total revenues as such unreimbursed costs are of total costs of patients who are neither Medicare nor Medicaid patients.  Provides that such unreimbursed costs shall be paid through distribution of funds pooled at the statewide level, through a higher payment rate, or through another method approved by the Secretary. <p>Requires a plan to have a mechanism for providing fair hearings for hospitals and any other entities aggrieved by determinations made under the plan. <p>Requires a State to provide for the appointment of a panel, consisting of members with expertise in health care economics and service delivery, to advise in the development and implementation of its plan, periodically review and propose modifications to the plan, and establish the methodology for establishing the percentage limit used to compute hospital revenues.  Requires such methodology to include the use of appropriate external price indicators, the use of data from major collective-bargaining agreements for nonsupervisory hospital employees, and other appropriate indicators of wage costs.  Requires the methodology to be approved by the Secretary. <p>Requires a plan, to the extent that it provides for meeting plan requirements through a system which provides for the establishment of rates for hospital reimbursement for hospital inpatient services by an entity other than the hospital, to meet the following additional requirements:  (1) except as provided in clause (2), the plan must provide equitable treatment of all entities that pay for health services covered under the plan, of hospital employees, and of patients;  (2) if the plan is established under State law, the plan must take into account the proportion of costs associated with, and services covered by, the different payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, and may not permit undue shifting of proportions of costs among the different payors;  (3) the plan may not make available any discount in price to any purchaser unless the discount accurately reflects economic benefits to a hospital resulting from a service arrangement with a purchaser and the discount is made available to all other purchasers who can satisfy such service;  and (4) the plan must provide a procedure whereby, upon the request of a hospital, an adjustment can be considered to the rate limitation applicable under the plan to that hospital to reflect a significant change in the inpatient hospital services, increased costs for the compensation of employees, funds necessary to provide for the efficient operation of a hospital which the State has determined should remain in operation, and higher expenses associated with a regional tertiary care institution, teaching hospital, or children's hospital. <p>Directs the Secretary, in reviewing a plan which provides for control of hospital inpatient costs through a competitive mechanism, to take into account the degree to which the plan provides for the following or other measures to improve price competition among providers:  (1) the plan provides for open enrollment periods;  (2) the plan provides for the dissemination of information concerning different health benefits plans;  (3) the plan encourages innovation and public incentives to new forms of health care delivery and financing;  (4) there are negotiated prices and risk-sharing between insurers and health care providers;  and (5) the laws of the State do not impose legal barriers to competition in negotiated and other arrangements among insurers and health care providers. <p>Sets forth part B of title XXI entitled ""Residual Federal Program"" subpart I of part B entitled ""Transition Period.""

Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, after consultation with the Governors of the States in the region, to publish within six months after enactment of this Act a list identifying such powerplants and 1980 emissions and specifying the sulfur dioxide emissions reductions which each State must achieve. Authorizes the Governors of any two or more States in the region to reallot among agreeing States such required reductions, provided that the total reductions equal the required total. Prohibits court review of any such list or agreement. <p>Requires each State in the region, within three years after enactment of this Act, to submit a plan to achieve its required share of the reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions.

Requires the owner or operator of each such powerplant within such State to submit to the Administrator, by July 1, 1989, a plan for achieving such emission limitation.  Directs the Administrator to approve such plan or plan modification within 12 months if it meets the same criteria and deadline as required for a State plan. Makes any measures approved under such plan a requirement of an applicable implementation plan and an emission limitation for purposes of specified provisions of the Act, and makes it a violation of such provisions for any owner or operator to fail to:  (1) submit an approvable plan within the time prescribed; (2) comply with the plan; or (3) achieve the emission limitation as expeditiously as practicable but not later than January 1, 1996. <p>Authorizes, for purposes of State plans under this Act, the use of any emission reduction methods or programs, if:  (1) such methods or programs do not include the use of coal having a significantly lower sulfur content (as mined, disregarding reductions accomplished through precombustion cleaning) than the average sulfur content used by the powerplant during any six-month period in the five-year period ending December 31, 1983, with specified exceptions; (2) emissions limitations under such methods or programs are enforceable; and (3) emissions reductions occur within the State or within other agreeing States in the region. Provides that such authorized methods or programs may include: (1) any technological system of continuous emission reduction; (2) least emission dispatch to meet electric generating demand at existing generating capacity; (3) retirement of existing major emitting electric powerplants or portions thereof at an earlier date than provided in schedules on file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, or State utility regulatory agencies; (4) trading of emissions reduction requirements imposed under this Act and actual reductions not otherwise required under the Act; and (5) investments in energy conservation with which quantifiable reductions in emissions can be identified. Allows a State plan or plan modification to require emission reductions at sources other than existing major emitting electric powerplants, if such reductions are actual emission reductions not otherwise required under the Act. <p>Requires, for purposes of powerplant owner or operator plans which are submitted when State plans have not been approved on time, that authorized reduction methods or programs:  (1) meet all the requirements for those under State plans; (2) reduce emissions at sources owned or operated by the person submitting the plan (with specified exceptions); and (3) be limited to technological systems of continuous emission reduction, least emission dispatch to meet electric generating demand at existing generating capacity, early retirement of powerplants, and trading of emission reduction requirements and actual reductions (whether or not such requirements or reductions occur at sources owned or operated by the person submitting the plan). <p>Directs States and the Administrator to establish emission reduction banks or brokerage institutions to facilitate trading in emissions reduction requirements imposed under this Act and actual reductions not otherwise required under the Act. <p>Directs the Administrator, before October 1, 1989, to contract with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to study and report on: (1) the significant adverse effects on public health and welfare which may reasonably be associated with atmospheric deposition of acidic compounds; (2) areas of the country which are, or are exposed to a significant risk of, experiencing such effects; (3) whether and to what extent particular sources in particular areas can reasonably be associated with the atmospheric acidic compounds associated with such risks and effects; and (4) the availability of controls for such sources and the social and economic costs of controlling them so as to eliminate or significantly mitigate such risks and effects.

Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress, before June 1, 1997, draft legislation to require, if necessary, further emission control strategies that are consistent with the NAS report. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to issue an innovative control order to an existing major emitting electric powerplant, after consultation with the Governor of the State where the plant is located, upon determination that: (1) the plant owner or operator will expeditiously use an innovative emission limitation system which is reasonably likely to be adequately demonstrated, upon expiration of the order, at one or more facilities; (2) such system is not likely to be used at the plant unless such order is granted; (3) the owner or operator has demonstrated that the proposed system will not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare or safety in its operation, function, or malfunction; and (4) the granting of such order will not make the total number of such orders with respect to such system exceed that which the Administrator finds appropriate to ascertain whether or not such system has been adequately demonstrated or will achieve an equivalent continuous reduction at lower cost in terms of energy, economic, or nonair quality environmental impact. <p>Requires that such innovative control orders:  (1) specify a final date of compliance with emission limitations under this Act, which shall not be later than January 1, 1996, with specified exceptions; and (2) set forth compliance schedules containing increments of progress which require such compliance as expeditiously as practicable. <p>Requires a source, during the period covered by an innovative control order, to comply with interim requirements which the Administrator: (1) determines are reasonable and practicable; and (2) specifies in the order. <p>Prohibits any enforcement action from being pursued based upon noncompliance with any emission limitations under this Act which is covered by the innovative control order during the period for which such order is in effect. <p>Makes any compliance schedule or interim requirement imposed in an innovative control order a requirement of an applicable implementation plan and an emission limitation for purposes of specified provisions of the Act. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to revoke, extend, or modify an innovative control order upon specified determinations. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to issue a compliance coal order to an existing major emitting electric powerplant allowing that source to comply in whole or part with an emission limitation under this Act by using coal having a significantly lower sulfur content than coal used by the source during any six-month period in the five-year period ending December 31, 1983, upon determination that:  (1) the plant is subject to an emission limitation under this Act; (2) the only feasible way of complying with such emission limitation which is authorized under this Act would involve the installation and use of a technological system of continuous emission reduction; and (3) the costs of installing and operating that system would be grossly disproportionate to any local or regional economic disruption or unemployment which would result from the use by that plant of such lower sulfur content coal. <p>Prohibits the granting of any compliance coal order unless the annualized capital and operating costs of a technological system of continuous emission reduction, as determined by the Administrator, are at least 20 percent greater than the baseline model estimate (BME) of the annualized capital cost of a system as calculated in a specified manner.  Directs the Administrator, within six months after the enactment of this Act, to develop a baseline model to estimate representative retrofit capital and operating costs of technological systems of continuous emission reduction, following specified procedures and taking specified factors into account. <p>Provides that any reduction in the sulfur content of coal accomplished through precombustion cleaning be disregarded in determining for purposes of this Act the average sulfur content of coal used by a plant during any six-month period in the five-year period ending December 31, 1983. <p>Directs the Administrator to consult with the Governor of the State in which the plant is located, and the Governors of the States where the coal used by that plant is mined, prior to issuing a compliance coal order. <p>Requires that a compliance coal order have a five-year duration, and allows extensions for additional five-year periods. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to revoke, extend, or modify a compliance coal order upon specified determinations. <p>Makes a term or condition of a compliance coal order a requirement of an applicable implementation plan and an emission limitation under specified provisions of the Act. <p>Establishes in the U.S. Treasury an Acid Deposition Control Trust Fund.  Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish the Fund within one year after enactment of this Act. <p>Provides that the Fund shall continue in existence until all distributions have been made in accordance with this Act. Provides that any amount remaining in the Fund on January 1, 2006, shall be used to make additional payments which may be required on account of past underpayments.  Provides that, after such additional payments have been made, and all repayments into the Fund required on account of past overpayments have been collected, any remaining amount in the Fund shall be distributed to the owners and operators of existing major emitting electric powerplants in proportion to the amount of fees they paid during the Fund's lifetime, but only if they pass on such refunded payment to their current customers in the form of a rebate or rate reduction. <p>Directs the Secretary to:  (1) be the Fund's trustee; (2) manage the Fund by investing in a specified manner any portion of the Fund not required to meet current obligations; (3) report annually to Congress on the financial condition of the Fund; and (4) make a final report, and accounting, to Congress at the termination of the Fund. <p>Requires the payment into the Fund of acid deposition impact region user fees by owners and operators of existing major emitting electric powerplants located within the region. Requires such fee payment to begin January 1, 1985, and to continue until December 31, 1999.  Sets the amount of the fee on the basis of electricity generated by such plant:  (1) during 1985, at one mill per kilowatt-hour; (2) during 1986, at two mills per kilowatt-hour; and (3) during 1987 through 1999, at three mills per kilowatt-hour.  Exempts from such fee payment determinations any unit of such a plant which: (1) operates a technological system of continuous emission reduction which was not installed to meet requirements under this Act; and (2) operates such emissions control equipment to remove 70 percent or more of potential combustion emission of sulfur dioxide. <p>Directs the Administrator, within six months after enactment of this Act, and after consulting with the Secretary, to issue regulations governing the conditions under which payments will be made from the Fund. Directs the Administrator, beginning after January 1, 1992, and ending by December 31, 2005, to make annual payments from the Fund to owners or operators of existing major electric powerplants. Requires that such payments cover:  (1) 90 percent of all annual capital costs, and 50 percent of all annual operating costs, of control technology which the Administrator determines to be necessary to comply with specified requirements of this Act; or (2) 90 percent of all such capital costs and 90 percent of all such annual operating costs as the Administrator determines to be necessary to comply with specified requirements of this Act if an innovative control technology is used.  Limits payment of such costs to specified periods ending on or before December 31, 2005. Prohibits payments from the Fund to cover:  (1) costs not essential to the construction, retrofit, and operation of the control equipment; (2) financing costs above the acceptable range of interest costs available to the utility; or (3) capacity or energy losses resulting from the retrofitting of an emission reduction system. <p>Directs the Administrator to publish, within 18 months after the enactment of this Act, regulations specifying procedures for approving and making payments from the Fund to cover all applicable costs according to specified criteria. Authorizes the Administrator to delegate to a State, at its request and if it has an approved State plan, the authority to approve such payments, subject to the Administrator's approval. <p>Prohibits any annual operating cost payment during any period in which the major existing electric powerplant is not in compliance with any applicable requirements under this Act. Provides that any operating costs incurred during any such period shall not be considered in determining whether overpayments or underpayments have been made.  Prohibits any annual capital cost payment during any period in which the powerplant is not in compliance with any compliance schedule under this Act, unless such plant is making a good faith effort. <p>Directs the Administrator, within 24 months after the enactment of this Act, and after consultation with the Secretary, to promulgate regulations governing the making of payments from the Fund and the collection of overpayments. Sets forth requirements relating to such regulations. <p>Sets forth civil and criminal fines for specified failures to pay fees or repayments under this Act. <p>Allows up to $50,000,000 per year from the Fund to be used for the development and demonstration of sulfur dioxide emission control technologies and for specified research authorized under the Energy Security Act of 1980. <p>Provides that no payments from the Fund shall be considered as ""income"" for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, or as ""rate relief"" for purposes of any State regulatory system. Provides that no capital or operating expenses which are compensated under this Act shall be used to reduce any tax obligation under the Internal Revenue Code. <p>Directs the Administrator to make payments of up to $40,000,000 from the Fund to the NAS for services performed pursuant to the contracts for the study and report under this Act. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to delegate to a State, at its request and if it has an approved State plan, the authority to approve payments required under provisions of this Act relating to the Fund.",,,,,,

Sets forth the procedures (referred to in clause one above) for the withholding from income of support payments. <p>Provides that under such procedures:  (1) amounts withheld must comply with the support order; (2) withholding must be initiated without application in the case of a child who is already receiving services under part D, and will be initiated with an application in the case of any other child; (3) withholding must be carried out in full compliance with all procedural due process requirements and must begin as soon as feasible; (4) withholding must be administered by a public agency (or a publicly accountable agency) designated by the State, and amounts withheld must be expeditiously distributed; (5) the State must provide advance notice to each individual who will have payments withheld and information as to how to contest the withholding; (6) State law must give priority to support collection over any other legal process against the same wages; (7) there will be withholding from all forms of income; (8) provisions must be made for terminating withholding; and (9) arrangements will be made with other States providing for reciprocal withholding.  Requires, in addition, under such procedures that:  (1) an employer withhold ordered payments (which shall include a fee to be paid to the employer) when provided with written notice; (2) an employer be held liable to the State for failure to withhold; and (3) a fine be imposed on any employer who refuses to employ or takes disciplinary action against any individual subject to wage withholding because of the existence of the withholding and additional obligations imposed on the employer.  Requires a State's laws to require withholding whenever arrearages occur, even if an application for services under part D is not filed.  Provides exemptions from the requirements of this paragraph, subject to the Secretary of Health and Human Services' continuing review, for States demonstrating that the enactment of any of this paragraph's requirements will not improve the State's support enforcement program. <p>Authorizes a State to use the funds available under part D for automated management systems to facilitate the development and improvement of income withholding procedures. <p>Requires a State, whenever a family for whom support payments have been collected and distributed under part D ceases to receive assistance under part A (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) of title IV, to:  (1) continue collecting support for up to three months; and (2) continue collection and payment to the family (without requiring reapplication) at the end of the three-month period on the same basis as in the case of individuals not receiving assistance under part A. <p>Repeals the current 12 percent incentive payment which is based on collections made on behalf of AFDC families.  Provides, under the new incentive payment provisions, that the basic incentive payment will be four percent of the State's AFDC collections plus four percent of the State's non-AFDC collections.  Provides that to the extent that AFDC or non-AFDC collections exceed the State's combined AFDC and non-AFDC administrative costs, higher incentives will be paid on a graduated scale of up to ten percent of AFDC and ten percent of non-AFDC collections. Caps the total dollar amount of incentive paid for non-AFDC collections at 125 percent of the incentive payment for AFDC collections. <p>Provides that the amount of incentive payments to be made to a State for any fiscal year shall be estimated by the Secretary before the beginning of such year and that the Secretary shall make such payments for such year on a quarterly basis, with the payments being reduced or increased to compensate for any prior overpayments or underpayments. <p>Authorizes the Secretary to make grants, in order to encourage and promote the development and use of more effective methods of enforcing support obligations under part D in cases where either the children on whose behalf the support is sought or their absent parents do not reside in the State where such cases are filed, to States proposing to undertake new or innovative methods of support collection in such cases. Authorizes appropriations for such grants. <p>Requires:  (1) review of a State's part D program at least once every three years; and (2) the operation by a State of a child support program (under part A) which is in substantial compliance with the State's part D plan. <p>Replaces current penalty provisions under part A with graduated penalties of two, three, and five percent in cases where a State's part D program does not meet applicable requirements. <p>Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Social Security Act to require any demonstration project undertaken which assists in promoting the objectives of part D of title IV to:  (1) be designed to improve the financial well-being of children, and prohibit modifications in the child support program which would have the effect of disadvantaging children in need of support; and (2) not result in increased costs to the Federal Government under part A of title IV. <p>Provides, under part D, that amounts collected by a State as child support on behalf of a child for whom a public agency is making foster care maintenance payments under part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV:  (1) shall be retained by the State to the extent necessary to reimburse it for foster care maintenance payments made; (2) shall be paid to the public agency responsible for supervising the placement of a child to the extent that amounts collected exceed foster care maintenance payments made with respect to the child but not amounts required by a court order to be paid on behalf of the child; and (3) shall be retained by the State if any portion of the amounts collected remains after making the payments required above, to the extent that such portion is necessary to reimburse the State for any foster care maintenance payments made for a child.  Requires any balance to be paid to the State agency responsible for supervising child care placement.  Requires a State, under part E, where appropriate, to take all steps to secure an assignment to the State of any rights to support on behalf of each child receiving foster care maintenance payments. <p>Requires collection by a State of spousal support under part D.  (Current law permits such collection.) <p>Requires the Secretary's annual report under part D to include the payment status of all active child support cases in each State, with specific information concerning: (1) interstate cases; and (2) the number of cases in certain defined categories. <p>Requires a State, under part D, to regularly publicize the availability of child support enforcement services, including a telephone number or address where further information can be obtained. <p>Requires a State, as a condition of eligibility for Federal payments under part A or D of title IV, to establish a State Commission on Child Support to examine, investigate, and study the operation of the State's child support system so as to determine the extent to which the system has been successful in securing support and parental involvement for both AFDC and non-AFDC children. Requires a report from the Commission.  Permits waivers of the requirement for a Commission in a State if the State already has its own commission, which is making satisfactory progress towards effective child support enforcement, or has in effect objective standards for child support obligations. <p>Directs the Secretary to approve a request from the State of Wisconsin to waive any requirement of part A or D of title IV so as to permit modifications of such State's programs under parts A and D in order to enable such State to make an adequate test of its Child Support Initiative, provided certain conditions are met. <p>Directs the Secretary to issue regulations requiring States to petition for the inclusion of medical support as part of any child support order whenever health care coverage is available to the absent parent at a reasonable cost. <p>Repeals the requirement that a State may not request the assistance of the Federal Parent Locator Service until the State has determined that the absent parent cannot be located through its own agencies. <p>Provides for the continuation of Medicaid (title XIX of the Social Security Act) eligibility for four months if a family loses AFDC eligibility because of the collection or increased collection of support under part D of title IV.",,,,,,

Requires that such identification include:  (1) polycyclic organic matter, nickel, toluene, coke oven emissions, acrylonitrile, carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, methyl chloroform, CFC-113, manganese, chromium, cadmium, chlorobenzenes, dioxin, vinylidene chloride, epichlorohydrin, chloroform, hexachlorocyclopentadiene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride; and (2) each other substance or material under EPA evaluation for inclusion on the NESHAPs list for which EPA has positive data from one or more tests indicating carcinogenicity in humans or other mammals.  Directs the Administrator, within one year of such enactment date, to identify at least 15 additional substances or materials for which an inclusion decision will be made by December 31, 1986. Requires that first consideration, in both such identifications, be given to specified substances and materials which the EPA has been evaluating. <p>Directs the National Toxicology Program, through its Director, to recommend substances or materials which should be so identified, and to continue to recommend substances and materials which may be appropriate for inclusion on the NESHAPs list. <p>Directs the Administrator, at the time the additional substances or materials are identified, to also identify any additional research, study, or evaluation which may be useful in making a determination.  Directs the Administrator, in cooperation with the National Toxicology Program, to:  (1) establish a schedule for initiating and completing such research, study, or evaluation; (2) identify the agency which will undertake it; and (3) identify the source and amount of funding for it, if such funding is not provided through the Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund. <p>Directs the Administrator, within 30 days after publication of any report under specified provisions of the Public Health Service Act, to publish a notice identifying each substance or material listed in such report which is known or may reasonably be anticipated to be an air pollutant.  Requires such notice to allow 60 days for interested parties to submit information and comment on whether any substance or material identified in such notice is a hazardous air pollutant. <p>Directs the Administrator, by December 31, 1985, in the case of those substances in the first identification and by December 31, 1986, in the case of the additional substances identified, to publish the determination of whether each substance or material is a hazardous air pollutant to be included on the NESHAPs list (along with the basis and the available information for such determination) after opportunity for submittal of information by interested parties. <p>Directs the Administrator, within one year after the required date for issuance of each notice relating to the Public Health Service Act list, to determine whether each substance or material identified in each such notice is a hazardous air pollutant. <p>Directs the Administrator, within 30 days after the identification of any substance or material required under this Act, to establish a docket for each such substance or material. Requires that such docket include all relevant information and analyses in the possession of the Administrator, all written comments and documentary information received from any person, and detailed written summaries of oral communications from or to any person on such issue. <p>Requires that a substance or material be included on the NESHAPs list, by operation of law, if the Administrator:  (1) fails to make a determination by the appropriate deadline; or (2) determines that such substance or material is a hazardous air pollutant. <p>Directs the Administrator to specify the chemical forms of a substance or material which are determined to be hazardous air pollutants when including such substance or material on the NESHAPs list. <p>Allows any interested party to petition the Administrator to remove any substance or material from the NESHAPs list, but only on the basis of information which was not available to the Administrator before the inclusion on such list. Directs the Administrator, within 120 days after receipt, to:  (1) make a finding whether the petition is based on such information; (2) if there is such a basis, to publish a notice of such finding and provide opportunity for public comment; and (3) within 120 days after such notice, publish a determination whether the substance or material is a hazardous air pollutant.  Provides that the pendency of any such petition shall not suspend the running time of any statutory or judicial time limit for the proposal or promulgation of NESHAPs standards. <p>Provides that neither the identification for determination purposes nor the automatic listing due to failure to meet the deadline shall be deemed a presumption that a substance or material is a hazardous air pollutant. <p>Directs the Administrator to identify the categories of sources which emit, in significant amounts, each hazardous air pollutant on the NESHAPs list.  Requires that such identification include specified categories of stationary sources. <p>Extends from 180 days to one year the period after proposal of emission standards during which the Administrator must establish final emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAPs). <p>Requires that NESHAPs be established at a level requiring the greatest degree of emission reduction of such pollutant through the application of the best system of continuous emission reduction available for the class or category of source, taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction and any nonair quality health or environmental impacts (BACT - the Best Available Control Technology).  Directs the Administrator to determine whether such emission standard is adequate to protect the public health from such hazardous air pollutant with an adequate margin of safety; and, if not, to establish such standard at a more stringent level.  Requires that NESHAPs be at least as stringent as the most stringent emission limitation shown by an adequate operating history to have been achieved in practice by a source of the same category or in a category with similar air pollutant control characteristics (LAER-the Lowest Achievable Emission Rate). <p>Authorizes the Administrator to distinguish among classes, types, sizes, and periods of remaining useful life for sources within a category of sources for purposes of establishing NESHAPs. <p>Revises NESHAPs prohibitions to require permits for:  (1) construction of new sources or modification of existing sources which emit or will emit any substance or material included on the NESHAPs list; and (2) operation of existing stationary sources which emit a hazardous air pollutant in violation of a NESHAPs standard.  Directs the Administrator to determine specified standards relating to such permits.  Directs the Administrator, in the case of such permits for operation of an existing source, to provide for compliance with NESHAPs standards as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than two years after the promulgation of the standard.  Requires that all such permits include specified monitoring requirements.  Limits the period of validity for such permits to seven years, with provisions for renewal.  Requires fees to cover costs of reviewing and acting upon such permit applications and implementing and enforcing the terms and conditions of such permits and renewals.  Requires that notice and opportunity for a hearing be provided within the locality where the source is located before any such permit or renewal may be issued. <p>Directs the Administrator to delegate NESHAPs implementation and enforcement authority to a State only if the State procedure:  (1) provides necessary assurances that the State will have adequate personnel, funding, and authority to carry out such implementation and enforcement; and (2) contains provisions equivalent to those provided under this Act for the issuance and renewal of permits, including requirements for monitoring and permit fees.  Provides that the grant or denial of a permit or permit renewal by a State to which such a delegation has been made shall be deemed an action of the Administrator for purposes of judicial review provisions of the Act. <p>Requires that design, equipment, work practice, and operational standards be consistent with specified requirements under NESHAPs provisions. <p>Allows a citizen lawsuit against the Administrator for failure to perform a nondiscretionary act or duty with respect to NESHAPs provisions, or with respect to provisions for listing certain unregulated pollutants, to be commenced ten days after the plaintiff has given notice to the Administrator. <p>Provides that specified amendments made by this Act shall not affect any NESHAP emission standard promulgated prior to the enactment of this Act.",,,,,,

Sets forth an alternative tax in the case of capital gains. Defines life insurance company taxable income as life insurance gross income reduced by life insurance deductions. <p>Defines life insurance gross income as the sum of: (1) premiums; (2) decreases in certain reserves; and (3) other amounts generally includible by a taxpayer in gross income.  Allows three types of deductions:  (1) general life insurance deductions; (2) the special life insurance deduction; and (3) the small life insurance company deduction.  Sets forth definitions and special rules for each type of deduction.  Sets forth rules for the calculation of net increases and decreases in reserves. <p>Requires life insurance companies to use either the accrual method of accounting or a method permitted under regulations which combines an accrual method with another recognized method.  Sets forth rules for the amortization of premiums and accrual of discount. Sets forth rules for the computation of a company's share and the policyholders' share of investment income. <p>Sets forth rules for the tax treatment of foreign life insurance companies.  Requires an adjustment to LICTI where a required surplus held in the United States is less than a specified amount. Sets forth rules for the tax treatment of contiguous country branches of domestic life insurance companies. <p>Provides that life insurance company taxable income which has an existing policyholders surplus account shall be increased by any direct or indirect distribution to shareholders from such account. <p>Defines ""life insurance company"" as an insurance company which is engaged in the business of issuing life insurance and annuity contracts or noncancellable contracts of health and life insurance if its life insurance reserves plus unearned premiums and unpaid losses comprise more than 50 percent of its total reserves. <p>Sets forth rules for the tax treatment of variable contracts.  Sets forth rules relating to capital gains and losses of a life insurance company. <p>Sets forth the effective date for the provisions of this Act. Provides transitional rules. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Taxation of Life Insurance Products</b> - Redefines ""life insurance contract"" for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.  Defines such a contract as any contract, which is a life insurance contract under applicable State or foreign law, but only if the contract meets either of two alternatives:  (1) a cash value accumulation test; or (2) a test consisting of a guideline premium requirement and a cash value corridor requirement. Specifies requirements of each such test.  Sets forth rules for contracts not meeting the life insurance definition.  Sets forth transitional rules. <p>Treats as distributed to a contract holder any amount of an annuity contract held by an individual who dies before the annuity starting date.  Exempts any such amounts from the five-percent penalty tax on a premature distribution from an annuity. <p>Limits the amount of the interest deduction allowed in the case of life insurance loans.  Sets forth rules for the calculation of such limit. Extends to former employees and key employees the limitations on group-term life insurance purchased for employees. <p><b>Subtitle C:  Nondeductible Contributions to Individual Retirement Plans</b> - Allows certain nondeductible contributions to individual retirement accounts and annuities.  Limits such contributions to the least of:  (1) $1,750; (2) the excess of compensation includible in gross income over the amount allowable as a deduction under present rules; or (3) an amount designated by the taxpayer as a nondeductible contribution. <p><b>Subtitle D:  Studies</b> - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to specified committees of the Congress on the revenues received by this Act and to compare the amount of such revenues and the amount anticipated by reason of changes made by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and this Act. <p>Requires the Secretary to make annual reports in the years 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1989 concerning the impact of this Act on specified segments and products of the life insurance industry.",,,,,,

Sets forth guidelines for such interest rates. <p>States that such standard and special interest rate rules shall not take effect until: (1) they have been transmitted to the Senate and House agricultural committees; and (2) 30 days of continuous session of Congress have expired after the date of transmittal. <p>Requires the Administrator to:  (1) establish a reserve in each account to cover the cost of loans made at the ""special"" rate; and (2) annually put into each reserve an amount equal to one percent of the previous year's principal and interest payments.  States that if either reserve is inadequate to cover such costs the Secretary of Agriculture shall include a request for the necessary funds in his or her next budget request. <p>Requires the Administrator to review each ""special"" loan every five years to determine continued borrower eligibility. <p>Requires (presently authorizes) the Administrator to:  (1) guarantee loans or to accommodate or subordinate liens or mortgages held in the Fund; and (2) promulgate implementing rules within 90 days. <p>Requires rural electrification borrowers to obtain concurrent supplemental financing according to prescribed guidelines in any fiscal year in which the minimum loan level for insured rural electrification loans is less than $1,000,000,000. <p>Repeals the FY 1991 termination date on the obligation of the United States to purchase Rural Telephone Bank capital stock. <p>Repeals certain provisos governing the loan-making authority of the Governor of the Rural Telephone Bank which require approval by the Secretary of Agriculture of facilities or lines to be acquired with such loans.

Authorizes such appropriations in a specified amount for FY 1983.  Limits the authorization of such appropriations in each succeeding fiscal year to an amount equal to the product of $10,000 multiplied by 20 percent of the number of ""long-term unemployed individuals"" (i.e., the average number of individuals in the civilian labor force who, in the first three months of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is to be made, had been unemployed for 15 or more weeks as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a seasonally adjusted basis). <p>Defines as ""eligible entities,"" under specified circumstances:  (1) States; (2) local governments with populations of 50,000 or more; (3) consortia of local governments; (4) existing concentrated employment program grantees serving rural areas under the Job Training Act; and (5) Native American Indian, Alaska Native, and Oklahoma Indian groups. <p>Makes individuals aged 16 or older eligible to participate in such program only if they are unemployed at the time of eligibility determination and for at least 15 of the 20 weeks prior to such determination, with specified exceptions. <p>Limits wages for eligible individuals to 52 weeks in a two-year period.  Requires that priority be given to those who have exhausted unemployment insurance benefits and those who have been unemployed for the longest periods immediately preceding selection. <p>Allocates 73 percent of grant funds under this Act in any fiscal year to specified eligible entities (States, local governments and consortia, and rural concentrated employment programs) within which the average unemployment rate for the preceding 12-month period was nine percent or more of the civilian labor force.

Allocates five percent to States for use in high unemployment areas which are not being served by eligible entities.  Reserves two percent for eligible Native American groups. Reserves five percent for distribution in the Secretary's discretion. <p>Provides that the 73 percent and 15 percent allocations to eligible entities shall be distributed on the basis of relative numbers of: (1) unemployed individuals; (2) unemployed individuals residing in areas of substantial unemployment (i.e., those areas which are of sufficient size and scope to sustain a program under this Act and which had an average rate of unemployment of at least six and one-half percent for the most recent 12 months); and (3) ""excess unemployed individuals"" (i.e., the number of individuals which is in excess of four and one-half percent of the civilian labor force). <p>Provides that the five percent allocation to States shall be made available by Governors to areas which did not qualify for the other allocations but which have:  (1) had an average civilian unemployment rate of nine percent or more for the three most recent months; (2) had large-scale losses of jobs caused by the closing of facilities, mass layoffs, natural disasters, or similar circumstances; or (3) experienced sudden or severe economic dislocations. <p>Provides that funds reserved for Native American eligible entities shall be allocated on an equitable basis, taking into account the extent to which regular employment opportunities have been lacking.

Provides that such plans shall be deemed acceptable unless, within 30 days of the filing, the Secretary:  (1) finds that a plan violates the provisions of this Act; and (2) provides a written explanation to the eligibility entity.  Grants such entity 30 days to file a revised plan. <p>Requires eligible entities to give priority to projects on the basis of the:  (1) severity and duration of unemployment within localities; (2) degree to which project activities will lead to the expansion of unsubsidized employment in the private sector; (3) level of need for activities and services; and (4) extent of coordination with economic and community development activities funded from sources other than this Act. <p>Limits to 25 percent that portion of the funds provided to any eligible entity which may be used for the cost of administration (including supervision) and the acquisition of supplies, tools, and equipment.  Requires that the remainder of such funds be used to provide wages and related employment benefits to eligible participants. <p>Requires that eligible participants be employed in community improvement projects, in one or more listed activities involving: (1) public facilities repair, rehabilitation, or improvement; (2) public lands conservation, rehabilitation, or improvement; or (3) public safety and health. <p>Sets forth general requirements relating to employment and projects under this Act.

Requires the written concurrence of the labor organization and the employer concerned before any such program which would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement may be undertaken. Prohibits program participants from being employed or job openings being filled when:  (1) any other individual is on layoff from the same or any substantially equivalent job; or (2) the employer has terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced its work force with the intention of filling the vacancy by hiring a participant whose wages are subsidized under this Act.  Prohibits creation of jobs in a promotional line that will infringe in any way on the promotional opportunities of currently employed individuals. <p>Requires recipients of funds under this Act to provide the Secretary with assurances that none of such funds will be used to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.  Requires that an opportunity for comment be provided for any labor organization representing a substantial number of employees engaged in similar work or training in the same areas as that proposed to be funded under this Act. <p>Applies the wage rate requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act to all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in works federally assisted under this Act. <p>Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 and for succeeding fiscal years to enable the United States Employment Service to provide funds to State employment service agencies to:  (1) certify and refer unemployed individuals as eligible for program participation; and (2) assist program participants in finding regular unsubsidized employment.",,,,,,
