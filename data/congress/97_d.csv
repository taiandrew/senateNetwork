Permits the Administrator to: (1) extend the periods for public comment and for approval, by up to 60 days; and (2) hold public hearings on SIP revisions. Provides that an SIP approval shall not be effective unless the Administrator finds, and publishes, that the State's response to any objection filed both during the State's proceedings and the Administrator's public comment period was not arbitrary or capricious. <p>Repeals the requirement that SIPs provide for periodic inspection and testing of motor vehicles to enforce compliance with applicable emission standards. Prohibits the Administrator from requiring, as a condition of SIP approval, any indirect source review program or, except as specified in provisions for nonattainment areas, any program of periodic inspection and testing of motor vehicles.  Permits States to include, and the Administrator to approve, such programs in SIPs. <p><b>New Source Performance Standards</b> - Limits the applicability of the percentage reduction requirement for new fossil fuel fired stationary sources to those categories of stationary sources to which such requirement were applied under regulations in effect as of December 31, 1981. <p>Provides that NSPS apply only to stationary source construction or modification commenced after NSPS regulations are promulgated (currently, proposed). <p><b>Enforcement</b> - Provides a one-year period for compliance after issuance of specified Federal enforcement orders (not including Federal orders relating to violations of national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants or State enforcement orders).  Repeals a requirement that the Administrator seek an injunction or assess a civil penalty in the case of any major stationary source not in compliance within 30 days of such a Federal enforcement order. <p>Provides discretionary authority for the Administrator to seek injunctions or assess penalties any case of noncompliance which last beyond 30 days enforcement orders (and continues such discretionary authority in cases not involving major stationary sources). <p>Directs the Administrator to carry out specified enforcement authorities through the use of full-time Federal officers or employees.  States that contractors should be used only as necessary to provide technical support for such enforcement. Prohibits the Administrator from contracting with anyone other than a full-time Federal officer or employee to provide legal assistance for such enforcement. <p>Revises enforcement provisions relating to major stationary sources which burn petroleum products or natural gas to cover such sources which voluntarily convert to an alternate fuel.  Includes other alternate fuels under the enforcement provisions which currently cover conversion to coal by such sources. <p>Requires (currently allows) each State to develop and submit to the Administrator a plan for carrying out noncompliance penalty provisions in such State. Repeals the authority of the Administrator to carry out noncompliance penalty provisions in a State under certain conditions.  Authorizes (currently requires) the State, or the Administrator if the State has not received a delegation, to carry out penalty provisions to assess and collect a noncompliance penalty in specified circumstances.  Authorizes the State to grant exemptions from penalties in cases of minor noncompliance (and continues the authority of the Administrator, when appropriate, to do so).  Repeals a requirement that the Administrator send notices of noncompliance to specified persons, in the event the State fails to send such notices. <p>Requires persons receiving such notices to submit a calculation of the amount of penalty owed and a schedule of payments within a reasonable period prescribed by the Administrator or the State (currently requires such submission within 45 days of notice issuance or petition denial).  Makes a similar change in the deadline for submissions of  petitions challenging such notice or alleging entitlement to an exemption.  Provides that public hearings on such petitions be conducted by the Administrator or the State, as appropriate, and that decisions on such petitions be made within a reasonable time (currently requires the Administrator to hold such hearings unless the State agrees to do so and currently requires a decision within 90 days after receipt of the petition). Repeals provisions authorizing the Administrator to review State decisions on such petitions and requiring such review under certain conditions.  Authorizes the State or the Administrator, as appropriate, to adjust or compromise any penalty assessment if the source is in compliance.  Repeals provisions for:  (1) final adjustments of penalties after compliance; and (2) Administrator objections to, and substitutions for, State noncompliance penalties. Revises requirements for noncompliance penalty assessed amount determinations and payment schedules. <p>Authorizes the Administrator, after notice and public hearing, to revoke or suspend any delegation under noncompliance penalty provisions upon determination that a State is not complying with such provisions. <p><b>Attainment Date Extensions</b> - Permits States to receive up to five-year extensions beyond the December 31, 1982, national primary ambient air quality standard (""primary NAAQS"") attainment date for pollutants in nonattainment areas (currently the Act permits such extensions for carbon monoxide and photochemical oxidants). Requires, in order to receive such extensions, that a State:  (1) certify to the Administrator that attainment is not possible before December 31, 1982, despite implementation of all reasonably available measures; and (2) commit itself to not modifying State nonattainment plan provisions so as to adversely affect reasonable further progress.  Directs the Administrator to publish notice of such certification and afford an opportunity of not more than 60 days for public comment, including a hearing where appropriate.  Directs to Administrator, if satisfied that such attainment is not possible, to extend the deadline to a date providing for attainment as expeditiously as possible, but not later than December 31, 1987. <p>Grants the Administrator discretionary authority, upon State application and after notice and public hearing, to provide an additional extension of an attainment date for any NAAQS, for up to six years beyond the December 31, 1987 extension.  Conditions such additional extensions on a State demonstration that: (1) the State has made good faith efforts to make reasonable further progress toward attainment during the previous extension period and has achieved annual incremental reductions in emissions of the air pollutant concerned; (2) all applicable SIP provisions, including those relating to legislative and funding actions and reasonably available control technology (or alternative measures that achieve equal or greater reductions in emissions) are being adequately implemented; (3) air quality problems are so severe and persistent, for identified reasons, that the previous extended deadline cannot be attained; and (4) in the case of requests for additional extensions for carbon monoxide or photochemical oxidants, the State has adopted and will implement in a cost- effective manner a program of motor vehicle inspection and maintenance not inconsistent with the purposes and requirements of title II (Emissions Standards for Moving Sources) of the Act.  Directs the Administrator to promulgate guidelines for SIP revisions, including guidelines respecting the terms of such additional extensions. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to prohibit issuance of a construction or modification permit for any major stationary source which emits a pollutant for which a NAAQS has not been attained by the appropriate deadline.  Permits case-by-case waivers of such prohibition for the construction of any new stationary source to replace an existing stationary source, upon determination by the permitting authority that emissions from the new source of each air pollutant for which the area is designated a nonattainment area will be less than such emissions from the existing source.  Directs the Administrator to: (1) enforce such permit requirements by issuing an order or bringing a civil action; and (2) seek an injunction or assess a civil penalty for violations of such prohibitions against construction or modification. <p><b>Nonattainment (other amendments)</b> - Revises other part D provisions for permit requirements in nonattainment areas to require that proposed new or modified major stationary sources comply with the best available control technology (BACT) standard, in the case of permits issued on or after the enactment date of this Act (compliance with the lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) standard is thus required only for permits issued before such date). <p>Repeals a requirement that SIP provisions for nonattainment areas establish a specific schedule for implementation of a vehicle emission control inspection and maintenance (I/M) program in order to qualify for a deadline extension in meeting the primary NAAQS for photochemical oxidants or carbon monoxide. <p>Requires that SIP nonattainment provisions for urban areas with greater that 500,000 population, in which the 1981 photochemical oxidants and/or carbon monoxide level exceeded the respective primary NAAQS by 50 percent or more, must contain a cost-effective program applicable to in-use motor vehicle emissions and not inconsistent with title II (Emission Standards for Moving Sources) of the Act. Requires that such program include an I/M program, if the State deems this appropriate.  Allows a State to decide that the I/M program will apply first to motor vehicle fleets and commercial operators and then, when the State determines necessary for attainment, to other vehicles.  Permits any State to:  (1) continue an I/M program for any nonattainment area which does not fall under the new requirements concerning urban areas with the above-mentioned population and pollution areas; or (2) submit revisions to modify or eliminate such program. <p>Makes specified emissions level requirements for construction and operation in nonattainment areas inapplicable in the case of any SIP under which:  (1) the construction or modification of specified stationary sources is required to comply with the best available control technology (BACT) standard; (2) an adequate emissions inventory is maintained; (3) all existing major stationary sources will be in compliance with emission limitations based upon reasonably available control technology (RACT) not later than 1987 (or earlier, as appropriate); (4) notwithstanding the construction of new major stationary sources, there is a program for obtaining such annual reductions in emissions as represent reasonable further progress; and (5) annual increased emissions resulting from source construction or modification shall not exceed one percent of the inventoried emissions of the applicable pollutant in the nonattainment area. <p>Provides that the Administrator shall apply on a gradual or partial basis the authority to withhold Federal grant funds for sewage treatment and highways in cases of noncompliance with the Act as appropriate to the severity of such violations. <p><b>Prevention of Significant Deterioration</b> - Revises provisions for Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality (PSD). (PSD provisions currently specify allowable short-term and long-term ""increments"" of emissions of sulfur oxide and particulate matter - regulations for other pollutants are not yet final - in areas with cleaner air than that required by NAAQS.  (Currently the smallest increments are allowed in ""class I"" areas, which include ""statutorily designated"" large national parks and wilderness areas, with larger increments in ""class II"" areas, and the largest increments in ""class III"" areas.) <p>Repeals the ""increment"" limitations (specified ""maximum allowable increases over baseline concentrations"") for class II and class III areas. <p>Eliminates the short-term increment limitations for class I areas. <p>Permits State Governors to rule that concentrations of particulate matter attributable to fugitive dust from specified sources shall not be taken into account in determining compliance with maximum allowable increases in ambient concentrations. <p>Eliminates provisions for PSD area redesignations as class III areas. <p>Provides that PSD preconstruction requirements shall only apply to physical or operational changes resulting in a significant net increase in source emissions of any air pollutant regulated under provisions for NAAQS, NSPS, or NESHAPs.  Sets a de minimis amount for such increase at 100 tons per year (1,000 tons per year of carbon monoxide) for any air pollutant for which a NAAQS is established (except lead) and 18 tons per year for fluorides. <p>Revises PSD preconstruction review analysis requirements to grant discretion to the permitting authority in determining whether continuous air quality monitoring data is necessary to determine whether emissions from a facility will exceed maximum allowable increases (class I area increments) or maximum allowable concentrations (primary and secondary NAAQS). <p>Requires PSD preconstruction permit programs to: (1) notify applicants within two months after receipt as to whether or not the application is complete and in what respects an incomplete application should be modified; and (2) issue or deny the permit within seven months after a completed application is received. Authorizes any officer or employee of a permitting agency to communicate and meet with any applicant, prior to submission of an application, to clarify PSD preconstruction permit requirements. <p>Eliminates the requirement that PSD regulations for hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, photochemical oxidants, and nitrogen oxides contain measures at least as effective as the ""increment"" limitations for sulfur oxides and particulate matter. Provides that the Administrator shall promulgate PSD regulations, as appropriate, for any such pollutant (thus repealing a specific deadline for such regulations).  Deletes the requirement that the specific measures included in such regulations to evaluate permit applications be ""numerical."" <p>Eliminates the special definition of ""best available control technology"" (BACT) for purposes of PSD provisions.  Defines BACT for purposes of the Act to mean the applicable New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) (the EPA-set technology-based standards for categories of industries), along with applicable national emission limitation standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAPs).  Retains determination of the BACT by the permitting authority on a case-by-case basis where no NSPS exists for a stationary source in a particular category.  Allows State and local governments to adopt or enforce standards or limitations more stringent than the BACT standard. <p><b>Visibility Protection</b> - Limits the applicability of specified visibility protection provisions to:  (1) ""significant"" impairments of visibility within mandatory class I Federal areas; and (2) ""significant"" adverse impacts on air quality related values (including visibility) on lands within class I areas. <p><b>Operation and Maintenance</b> - Requires that SIPs include a program for periodic audits of major stationary sources to insure the proper operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment used to comply with emission limitations.  Requires that the results of such audits be available to the public. Sets a deadline, six months after enactment of this Act, for submission of SIP revisions taking account of such requirements. <p><b>Emergency Variances</b> - Revises provisions for emergency variances from any SIP requirement applicable to a stationary source. Authorizes the President to issue such variances. Permits such variances to be issued when foreign imports of fuels used by a stationary source have reached an excessive level and such imports can be reduced by the emergency suspension.  Increases the maximum period for such temporary emergency suspensions to two years (currently four months), but prohibits any such suspension remaining in effect for more than four months if it results in a violation of any NAAQS.  Requires the person (a State Governor or the President) issuing any suspension for a period of more than four months to revoke such suspension upon determination that the stationary source did not change to an alternative fuel. <p><b>Administrative Review</b> - Revises provisions relating to international air pollution.  Directs the Administrator to:  (1) publish notice in the Federal Register upon receipt of specified information or allegations about such pollution originating in the United States; (2) receive public comments and conduct an investigation including public hearings respecting such pollution; and (3) make a finding as to whether any air pollutant emitted in the United States causes or contributes to air pollution in a foreign country. Provides that any finding that U.S. emissions cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in a foreign country shall be deemed to be a finding which requires an SIP revision. <p><b>Regulatory Stability</b> - Sets forth regulatory stability provisions establishing a ten-year ""grandfather"" period, commencing with construction or modification, during which a stationary source (unless subsequently modified) shall not be subject to more stringent requirements if the construction or modification is subject to NSPS, obtains a permit or approval, and meets all permit or approval requirements. Excludes from such ""grandfather"" provision any emission limitation or standard imposed on any stationary source with respect to:  (1) hazardous pollutants designated under NESHAP provisions; (2) pollutants with no NAAQS in effect at commencement of the construction; or (3) any other air pollutant, if the Administrator judges that the public health or welfare may be endangered. <p><b>Effective Data and Transitional Rules</b> - Sets forth an effective date and transitional rules for the amendments relating to Nonattainment provisions and to PSD provisions. <p><b>Title II: Ozone Protection</b> - Revises ozone protection provisions of the Act. <p>Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to continue ozone protection studies and research while increasing actual measurements of stratosphere ozone and improving methods of monitoring potential trends in such measurements. <p>Directs the Administrator to contract annually with the National Academy of Sciences to:  (1) continue review and research; (2) determine the extent, nature, and causes of changes in stratospheric ozone concentration (with particular attention to the effects of chlorofluorocarbons); (3) investigate unreasonable effects on health and the environment; and (4) report all findings and associated uncertainties. <p>Directs the National Academy of Sciences, in consultation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to report, within two years and annually therafter until such time as the theory of ozone depletion by chlorofluorocarbons has has been validated, all findings concerning actual or potential alteration of the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere, its causes, and associated implications and uncertainties. Requires that such report be made to the Administrator and to the Congress, with copies available to the public. <p>Requires that continuing research and monitoring programs be expanded to determine the extent, nature, causes, effects, and associated uncertainties of stratospheric ozone concentration changes. <p>Directs the President, within two years from the date of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, to report to the Congress and the public on efforts to reach international agreements among the major free-world producing countries of chlorofluorocarbons as to the nature, extent, and implications of any threat to the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere and as to the appropriate regulatory action to be taken. <p>Prohibits the Administrator from proposing further regulations for the control in the United States of any chlorofluorocarbon under the Act or the Toxic Substance Control Act until:  (1) the Administrator determines that depletion of the stratospheric ozone by chlorofluorocarbons at a rate determined to be eventually harmful to human health and the environment is actually detected; or (2) the President reports that international agreement has been reached as to the nature, extent, and implications of any threat to the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere and as to the appropriate regulatory action to be taken. <p>Provides that this Act shall not affect:  (1) the validity of regulations concerning aerosol propellants containing chlorofluorocarbons promulgated by the Administrator before the effective date of this Act; or (2) the Administrator's obligation to comply with other applicable requirements in adopting regulations for the control of chlorofluorocarbons. <p>Prohibits States or local governments from adopting or attempting to enforce any regulation (except ones controlling halocarbon use as an aerosol propellant) respecting the control of chlorofluorocarbons to protect the stratosphere or stratospheric ozone until the Administrator has promulgated regulations for such control in the United States. <p><b>Title III:  Authorization of Appropriations</b> - Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator for FY 1983 through FY 1987. <p>Provides for sums necessary for:  (1) the Administrator and the States to effectively carry out the Act's provisions, including training of State and local personnel, enforcement, abatement, and control, consideration of SIPs and revisions, and audits; and (2) sufficient funding for personnel for the Administrator to carry out the Act, particularly its regulatory functions, without undue reliance on contractors. <p>Requires that such authorization not be less than the appropriations authorized in fiscal year 1981 to carry out the Act (except provisions relating to the National Commission on Air Quality). <p>Prohibits the Administrator from using any funds appropriated under the Act for any payment for a reduction-in-force in any fiscal year.  Directs the Administrator to inform the appropriate committees of the Congress of the reasons for such reduction, its impact on carrying out the Act, and other detailed or pertinent information, at least 30 days prior to issuing any general notice of such reduction. <p>Declares that nothing in this title shall authorize appropriations for any research and development activities under the Act. <p><b>Title IV:  Acid Precipitation Study</b> - Amends the Energy Security Act (title VII provisions also known as the ""Acid Precipitation Act of 1980"") to reduce the period covered by a comprehensive research plan from ten years to five years. Makes conforming amendments relating to implementation of, and authorization of appropriations for, the comprehensive research plan. <p>Directs the Acid Precipitation Task Force to submit a final report, with detailed recommendations, within five years of enactment of the Energy Security Act. <p>Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to submit recommendations, to accompany the final report of the Task Force, for specific changes in law supported by scientific findings of the Taks Force. <p>Prohibits the Administrator from proposing or promulgating any rule to control sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide emissions if such rule would expand the Administrator's existing regulatory authority, before the final report is transmitted. <p>Directs the Task Force to:  (1) study fuel precombustion treatment and low-polluting combustion processes for reduction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions; and (2) solicit information from State agencies conducting acid deposition research.",,,,,,

Sets forth requirements for the establishment of such trusts, including requirements that such trusts:  (1) be created pursuant to a plan adopted by the newspaper; (2) be governed by a written instrument which requires that contributions to and income of the trust be invested solely in obligations of the United States; (3) name as trustee a bank or another individual who is capable of administering such trust in compliance with the requirements of this Act; (4) maintain trust assets separately from other property; (5) accept contributions exclusively from independent local newspapers; (6) devote assets of the trust solely to the payment of the estate tax; and (7) distribute any excess funding of the trust to its beneficiaries or their estates. Limits an individual who owns interests in several independent local newspapers to participation in not more than one estate tax payment trust. <p>Defines an ""independent local newspaper"" as a newspaper publication which is not a member of a chain and which maintains all its offices in a single city, community or metropolitan area, or, on January 1, 1981, within one State.  Defines ""excess funding"" as the excess of the face value of the assets of a qualified trust over: (1) 70 percent of the value of a decedent's interest in an independent local newspaper which is includable in his gross estate; or (2) a decedent's estate tax which is attributable to his interest in an independent local newspaper included in his gross estate. <p>Exempts independent local newspaper advance estate tax payment trusts and the individuals for whom such trusts are established from income taxation with respect to income earned by such trust.  Terminates such tax-exempt status if the taxpayer's interest in the newspaper is sold, the newspaper itself is sold or ceases to qualify as an independent newspaper, or there is an excess funding of the trust. Provides that the amount of any excess funding shall be distributed to the individual for whom the trust was created and included in his gross income or gross estate. <p>Allows an income tax deduction to local independent newspapers for contributions made to estate tax payment trusts.  Limits the amount of such deduction to 50 percent of the taxable income derived from such newspaper for the taxable year. <p>Requires the redetermination of the estate tax of an individual for whom an independent local newspaper advance estate tax payment trust is established and the inclusion in the gross estate of such individual of an amount equal to the estate tax payment made by such trust which is attributable to the individual's interest in the newspaper, if the trust or any heir of the individual sells, within 15 years of the death of such individual, any part of the interest in the newspaper with respect to which the trust was created.  Provides for the gradual phaseout of any additional estate tax which is imposed due to the premature sale of a newspaper, if the sale does not occur prior to the ten to 15 year period following the death of the individual for whom the estate tax trust is established. <p>Permits the shareholders of an independent local newspaper who receive the stock of a corporation which the newspaper controls to exclude from their gross income any gain realized as a result of such distribution if:  (1) the shareholders do not sell such stock within five years after the date of its distribution; (2) the shareholders retain control of the newspaper for five years after the date of the distribution; and (3) the newspaper and the controlled corporation each continue to be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business through the five year period beginning on the date of the distribution. <p>Excludes from the gross estate of a decedent the value of any interest in an independent local newspaper which he holds at the time of his death and any estate tax payment made by an independent local newspaper advance estate tax payment trust. <p>Permits the executor of an estate which includes an interest in an independent local newspaper to pay the estate tax in two or more (but not exceeding ten) equal installments.  Limits the maximum amount of estate tax that may be paid in installments to the excess of the amount of estate tax over the tax that would have been imposed if the interest in the newspaper had not been included in the gross estate, reduced by all payments of the estate tax made by an independent local newspaper advance estate tax payment trust.",,,,,,

Exempts from the loss recognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code any straddle consisting entirely of offsetting positions which are regulated futures contracts.  Defines ""regulated futures contract"" as a contract: (1) which requires delivery of personal property; (2) with respect to which amounts deposited and withdrawn depend on a system of marking to market; and (3) which is traded on or subject to the rules of certain boards of trade. Exempts from the application of such rules any hedging transaction.

Treats as ordinary income any gain realized from the sale or exchange of short-term government obligations which does not exceed an amount equal to the ratable share of the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity over the taxapayer's basis. <p>Requires dealers in securities to identify securities which they acquire for personal investment purposes on the day such securities are acquired, for purposes of the capital gains tax treatment of such securities. <p>Excludes from capital gains tax treatment gains by a securities dealer from the sale or exchange of any security, unless the security was clearly identified in the dealer's records before the end of the day after the date of acquisition, as a security held for investment (currently, before the end of the 30th day after the date of acquisition).",,,,,,

Permits modification and resubmission of a comprehensive investment strategy which the Secretary of Agriculture has disapproved. <p>Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make implementation grants to an applicant if no practical alternative for providing financial assistance is available or if the applicant has or will have extraordinary short-term increases in demand for public facilities or services during the construction of a major energy development and there is no reasonable assurance of repayment of financial assistance within 30 years.  Restricts a grant in the latter case to 45 percent of the costs of providing public facilities and services to meet the peak demand.

Defines ""recovery property"" as depreciable tangible property (equipment or machinery) used in a trade or business or held for the production of income and placed in service after December 31,1980. <p>Establishes four classes and recovery periods for such property; (1) Class 1, two years; (2) Class 2, four years; (3) Class 3, seven years; and (4) Class 4, ten years.  Requires assignment of property to the class which has a recovery period at least 50 percent shorter than its present midpoint useful life under the Asset Depreciation Range (ADR).  Permits the taxpayer to elect placement of any item of property in the class with the next longer recovery period than the class to which it would otherwise belong. <p>Limits the amount of a recovery deduction to the aggregate determined by applying the recovery percentage for each class of property to the balance in the recovery account for such class at the end of the taxable year. Defines the recovery percentage as the percentage (100 percent, 150 percent, or 200 percent) selected by the taxpayer for a class of items, divided by the number of years in the corresponding recovery period. Requires a taxpayer to establish a recovery account for each class of recovery property.  Sets forth formulae for additions to and reductions in such account. Excludes from the application of such deduction the following kinds of property: (1) certain livestock; (2) property subject to amortization; (3) property depreciable on a basis other than time; (4) public utility property; (5) oil- or gas-fueled boilers; and (6) property used predominantly outside the United States. <p>Treats qualified progress expenditures, for purposes of the recovery deduction, as property placed in service. <p>Increases from 20 percent to 30 percent the ADR variance from class life for public utility property. <p>Revises the applicable percentage for determination of the investment tax credit to make eligible for such credit: (1) 40 percent of the basis of an asset if its useful life is between two and four years (currently, 33 1/3 percent if its useful life is between three and five years); (2) 75 percent of asset basis if its useful life is between four and seven years (currently, 66 2/3 percent if its useful life is between five and seven years); and (3) 100 percent of basis if its useful life is seven years or more (currently, the same).  Provides increased applicable percentages for purposes of applying the energy percentage and the employee plan percentage. <p>Allows election of: (1) 20-year straight line depreciation, with Section 1250 recapture, for structures and structural components; (2) 15-year straight line depreciation, with Section 1250 recapture, for low-income housing; and (3) 15-year declining balance depreciation, with Section 1245 recapture, of certain owner-occupied buildings used for industrial, retail, or catalog distribution purposes.  Disallows component depreciation for any taxpayer who makes such election. <p>Repeals provisions granting small businesses a first-year depreciation allowance for the cost of tangible personal property. <p>Increases the investment credit carryover (from seven to ten years), the net operating loss carryover for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1981 (to ten years), and the investment tax credit for rehabilitated nonresidential structures (from ten percent to 25 percent). <p>Repeals provisions disallowing the deduction for real property construction period interest and taxes.",,,,,,

Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, without regard to the rules of evidence, but permits information to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. <p>Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. <p>Includes as threshold, aggravating factors for homicide that the defendant:  (1) intentionally killed the victim; (2) intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury which resulted in death of the victim; (3) intentionally participated in an act which he reasonably should have known would create grave risk of death to a person and the victim did die as a direct result of the act; or (4) attempted to kill the President of the United States. <p>Sets forth special aggravating factors with respect to the crimes of treason and espionage. <p>Includes among the mitigating factors that the defendant was less than 18 years old at the time of the crime. <p>Conditions imposition of the death penalty on a unanimous finding by the jury that:  (1) some aggravating factor exists in addition to a threshold factor; and (2) the aggravating factors sufficiently outweigh any mitigating factor found to exist. <p>Directs the court to impose the death penalty upon a finding that such sentence is justified. <p>Requires the court to instruct the jury not to consider the race, color, national origin, creed, or sex of the defendant in its consideration of the death sentence. <p>Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death.  Allows the death penalty to be imposed for the murder of foreign officials and for an offense of kidnapping resulting in the death of any person.  Eliminates the death penalty for the crime of rape. <p>Authorizes the death penalty for the crime of attempting to kill the President of the United States if the attempt results in bodily injury to the President or otherwise comes dangerously close to causing his death. <p>Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence.  Requires the Court of Appeals, upon considering the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if: (1) the sentence was not imposed under influence of passion, prejudice, or arbitrariness; and (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors or the absence of mitigating factors.
