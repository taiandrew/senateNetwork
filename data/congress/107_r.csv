Requires the Secretary to review any such ordinance or resolution and authorizes its approval if it is consistent with this Act and will not increase fractionated ownership of Indian land.<p>Denies any responsibility of the Secretary to collect or account for lease revenues or royalties accruing to an interest held as a passive trust interest unless such interest is taken into active trust status on behalf of an Indian or an Indian tribe upon the Secretary's approval of an application to do so.<p>Authorizes Indian tribes to apply to the Secretary for the partition of land. Prescribes the partitioning process for parcels of land when different specified circumstances prevail.<p>(Sec. 4) Changes the consent condition for the purchase by an Indian tribe of all the interests in a tract of trust or restricted land. Reduces from over 50 percent of the undivided interests in such tract to undivided interests equal to at least 50 percent of the undivided interest in such tract the threshold amount of undivided interests of the owners whose consent the tribe must obtain to purchase all the interests in the tract.<p>Revises the prohibition against the Secretary's approval of a tribal probate code that prevents an Indian person from inheriting an interest in an allotment that was originally allotted to his or her lineal ancestor. Prohibits approval of a code, or an amendment to it, that prevents the devise of an interest in trust or restricted land to an Indian lineal descendant of the original allottee, or to an Indian who is not a member of the tribe that exercises jurisdiction over such an interest, unless the code provides for the renouncing of interests (to eligible devisees pursuant to such a code), the opportunity for a devisee who is the testator's spouse or lineal descendant to reserve a life estate, and payment of fair market value in a prescribed manner.<p>Restricts the obligatory transfer for fair market value of a fractional interest in Indian land from the deceased to the Indian tribe of jurisdiction if the interest is part of a family farm. Waives the tribe's right to acquire such an interest if the devisee (who is a member of the decedent's family) agrees that the tribe will have the opportunity to acquire the interest for fair market value if the interest is offered for sale to an entity that is not a member of the landowner's family.<p>Declares with respect to joint tenancy interests that: (1) nothing shall be construed to alter the ability of the owner of such an interest to convey a life estate in the owner's undivided joint tenancy interest; and (2) only the last remaining owner of such an interest may devise or convey more than a life estate in such an interest. Denies the application of this rule to: (1) any conveyance, sale, or transfer that is part of an agreement between a decedent's heirs and devisees to consolidate interests in trust or restricted lands; or (2) a co-owner of a joint tenancy interest.<p>Repeals the authority of the Secretary to acquire interests in trusts or restricted lands during the three year period of certification under the Pilot Program for the Acquisition of Fractional Interests in Indian Lands (Pilot Program).<p>Permits specified options (including payment by pledge of revenue from any source) for the purchase of Indian land by Indian owners who own at least five percent of undivided interest in a parcel of trust or restricted land.<p>Declares that the Secretary shall have a lien on any revenue accruing to Indian land under the Pilot Program.<p>Requires the Secretary to utilize the revenue in the Pilot Program Acquisition Fund to acquire undivided interests in restricted or controlled Indian lands.<p>Exempts any parcel of trust or restricted land that is part of a family farm conveyed to a member of the landowner's family from the right of the Indian tribe that exercises jurisdiction over the land, before the Secretary approves an application to terminate the trust status or remove restrictions on alienation of such parcel, to have the opportunity to acquire the land by matching the offer or paying the fair market value. Requires in such a case, however, that the tribe be afforded an opportunity to purchase the interest if it is offered for sale to an entity that is not a family member of the landowner.",,,,,,

Defines a ""brownfield site,"" with exceptions, as real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which is complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance or pollutant. Includes within such definition a site: (1) that is contaminated by a controlled substance; (2) that is contaminated by petroleum or a petroleum product excluded from the CERCLA definition of ""hazardous substance"" which is determined to be of relatively low risk, that is a site for which there is no viable responsible party and which will be cleaned up by a person not potentially liable, and that is not subject to a specified order under the Solid Waste Disposal Act; or (3) that is mine-scarred land. Authorizes appropriations. Requires at least 25 percent of such funding to be used for petroleum-contaminated sites.<p><b>Title II: Brownfields Liability Clarifications</b> - Exempts from liability under CERCLA certain owners of real property contiguous to property on which there has been a hazardous substance release or threatened release that is not owned by such persons.<p>(Sec. 202) Absolves from liability for response actions bona fide prospective purchasers to the extent liability at a facility for a release or threat thereof is based solely on ownership or operation of a facility. Gives a lien upon a facility to the United States for unrecovered response costs in any case for which the owner is not liable by reason of this section and the facility's fair market value has increased above that which existed before the action was taken.<p>(Sec. 203) Deems a person, with respect to defenses to liability of an owner of after-acquired property, to have undertaken appropriate inquiry into the property's previous ownership and uses if the person demonstrates that inquiries were undertaken in accordance with specified requirements (for property purchased after May 31, 1997, compliance with an American Society for Testing and Materials standard until standards are issued by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency). Deems the appropriate inquiry requirements to be satisfied by a facility inspection and title search that reveal no basis for further investigation in the case of property for residential or similar use purchased by a nongovernmental or noncommercial entity.<p><b>Title III: State Response Programs</b> -Adds CERCLA provisions authorizing the Administrator to award grants to States or Indian tribes to establish or enhance response programs comprised of elements including survey and inventory of brownfield sites, public participation opportunities, oversight and enforcement authorities, and certification mechanisms. Authorizes appropriations.<p>Restricts authority to take enforcement actions under CERCLA in cases of hazardous substance releases addressed by a State response plan. Authorizes the President to bring enforcement actions in certain instances, including cases where a State requests assistance, there is migration of contamination across State lines or onto Federal property, or there is an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment and additional response actions are likely to be necessary.<p>Makes restrictions on the President's authority to take such actions applicable only at sites in States that maintain, update at least annually, and make publicly available a record of sites at which response actions have been completed in the previous year and are planned to be addressed under the State response program in the upcoming year. Applies enforcement action requirements only to response actions conducted after February 15, 2001.<p>(Sec. 302) Requires the President to defer final listing of an eligible response site on the National Priorities List if the State is conducting a response action in compliance with a State response program that will provide long-term health and environmental protection or is actively pursuing an agreement to perform such an action with a capable person. Requires reasonable progress toward completion of actions for deferral of listing. Permits the President to decline to defer, or discontinue a deferral if: (1) deferral would be inappropriate because the State, as an owner, operator, or significant contributor is a potentially responsible party; (2) the criteria under the National Contingency Plan for issuance of a health advisory have been met; or (3) the other conditions under this section for deferral are no longer being met.",,,,,,
