Requires the Board, before issuing a commitment, to determine that:  (1) such a commitment is needed to enable Chrysler to continue to operate and the failure to meet this need would adversely and seriously affect the employment or economic situation in the United States or any of its regions, or the degree of competition in the automobile industry; (2) Chrysler has submitted a feasible operating plan for its 1980 fiscal year and the next three fiscal years demonstrating its ability to continue as a going concern in the automobile business without additional Federal assistance after December 31, 1983; (3) Chrysler has submitted a satisfactory financial plan which includes at least $1,650,000,000 in funds not guaranteed by the Federal Government, obtained through commitments and concessions contributed by persons with an existing economic stake in Chrysler and capital and cash acquired by merger, the sale of securities (including $50,000,000 to its employees), and otherwise after October 17, 1979; (4) Chrysler's existing creditors will continue to waive their rights under prior credit commitments in default unless the Board determines that the exercise of such rights will not adversely affect the operating and financial plans; and (5) all financing obtained will contribute to Chrysler's domestic economic viability. <p>Stipulates that the Board may issue guarantees only pursuant to commitments.  Requires such commitments to provide that guarantees will only be issued if the Board determines that:  (1) Chrysler would otherwise be unable to obtain credit upon reasonable terms sufficient to meet the needs of its operating plan; (2) there is a reasonable prospect of repayment; (3) the loan bears interest at a reasonable rate determined by the Board; (4) Chrysler continues to comply with an operating and financial plan or a revision which is feasible and satisfactory to the Secretary; (5) Chrysler has agreed to deliver rolling four-year operating and financial plans to the Secretary and an annual analysis of deviations in performance from the targets set forth in such plans; and (6) Chrysler has complied with the requirements set forth in the terms of any commitment. <p>Renders any determination made by the Board under this Act conclusive upon the issuance of a loan guarantee. States that the validity of any guarantee shall be incontestable except for fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of the holder thereof.  Authorizes the Board to determine the form of all guarantees issued under this Act. <p>Directs the Board to collect, at least once a year, a guarantee fee of at least one percent per annum on the outstanding guaranteed loan principal computed daily. Requires the Board to ensure that the Government is compensated for the risk it assumes in issuing guarantees through the collection of additional guarantee fees, contracts which allow the Government to share in Chrysler's profits, or other methods deemed appropriate by the Board. <p>Prohibits the issuance of any loan guarantee if Chrysler enters into a collective bargaining agreement with its union employees before September 13, 1982, which increases wages and benefits beyond the levels in effect on September 13, 1979, excluding specified increases in contributions to medical and pension plans. Prohibits increases which would accrue as a result of a cost-of-living allowance, an annual improvement factor, or an incentive job classification. Prohibits the payment of any wage or benefit increase on a deferred basis.  Prohibits the aggregate wages and benefits of Chrysler's non-union employees for any fiscal year beginning before December 31, 1982, from exceeding the total annual cost of such wages and benefits for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1979. <p>States that such limitations on wages and benefits shall not apply to increases required by law. Stipulates that a job reclassification or promotion effected to evade the provisions of this Act shall be considered an indirect form of compensation. <p>Prohibits the amount of outstanding guarantees of principal from ever exceeding $1,000,000,000. Sets forth limitations on the authority to issue guarantees based on the amount of nonfederally guaranteed financing obtained by Chrysler. <p>Requires that all guaranteed loans be payable in full no later than December 31, 1990. Prohibits waiver or amendment of the terms of any guaranteed loan without the Board's consent.  Requires each commitment to contain appropriate protective provisions.  Directs the Board to require security for loans under this Act, subordination of existing and future creditors, and that Chrysler pay no dividends on its common or preferred stock. <p>Authorizes the Board to inspect the records of Chrysler or any other borrower if a request for a loan guarantee is pending or outstanding.  Empowers the General Accounting Office to conduct audits of Chrysler and other borrowers deemed appropriate by the Comptroller General.  Directs the Office to report the results of such audits to the Congress and the Board. <p>Directs the Board to enforce the rights of the United States as a guarantor under this Act.  Entitles the Board to recover any payments made pursuant to a guarantee from Chrysler, its affiliates, or any other liable person.  Empowers the Board to utilize all available remedies in enforcing the rights of the United States and to bring actions in the United States district court or any other appropriate court to enforce compliance with this Act or the terms of any agreement.  Grants jurisdiction to such courts to hear such actions and to fashion appropriate remedies. <p>Prohibits the Board from guaranteeing any tax-exempt security either directly or indirectly if the guarantee provides significant collateral for other tax-exempt obligations. <p>Renders any provision of this Act severable from the other provisions if held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction. <p>Permits the Board to use any Federal Reserve bank as its fiscal agent provided the bank is reimbursed for any expenses or losses incurred acting in such capacity.",,,,,,

Includes as a manufacturer of ammunition a person whose gross sales of his own ammunition exceed $1,000 in any calendar year.  Includes as a dealer in firearms a person who deals in firearms as a regular course of business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms.

Eliminates the limitation that such qualified expenditures be made only with respect to the taxpayer's principal residence.  Raises from $2,200 to $5,000 the maximum amount of qualified renewable energy source expenditures allowable as a residential energy tax credit.  Qualifies the differential cost of renewable energy source property which is a structural component of a building as one such expenditure. <p>Extends eligibility for the residential energy tax credit to: (1) a landlord for installation of alternative energy equipment on rental residential property; and (2) a builder for installation of such equipment in a house built for sale (reserving such builder the option to pass such credit through to the first purchaser).  Applies such credit to lease payments on such equipment (so long as the lessor certifies that he has not taken the credit himself).  Permits a homeowner to file an amended return for his previous taxable year and receive such credit against the previous year's taxes for eligible energy expenditures in his current taxable year. <p>Extends the tax credit for photovoltaic systems to homeowners. <p>Revises the eligibility for such credit of the costs of drilling geothermal wells (but only if no deduction is taken for intangible drilling and development costs). <p>Extends coverage of the ten percent business investment tax credit to all solar and wind energy property, including structural modifications and components.  Allows an additional 20 percent energy investment tax credit for solar, wind, and geothermal expenditures.  Makes hydroelectric properties (other than dams) eligible for such additional 20 percent credit.  Makes wind-powered mechanical energy eligible for both credits. <p>Makes utilities and private enterprises eligible: (1) for the additional 20 percent credit for purchase and installation of all wind and solar equipment; and (2) for a further ten percent credit for purchase and installation of cogeneration equipment. <p>Makes heat pumps (including water well heat pumps) eligible for the 15 percent residential conservation credit and the ten percent energy tax credit for business. <p>Extends the expiration date for such credits through fiscal year 2000. <p>Increases the current four cents per gallon to a 40 cents per gallon exemption from the Federal special fuels diesel and gasoline excise taxes for each gallon of alcohol sold in an alcohol-gasoline (gasohol) mixture, and extends the expiration date of such exemption through fiscal year 2000.  Allows a credit against income tax for any amount in excess of the excise taxes refunded or credited pursuant to such exemption.  Includes the amount of such income tax credit in gross income for the applicable year. <p>Requires the Secretary of the Treasury's annual gasohol report to Congress to include: (1) a calculation of the need for continued gasohol incentives (and the appropriate level); and (2) a comparison of the cost of alcohols produced from corn, wheat, wood and other substances. <p>Allows van pools operated by non-employers (third parties or owner-operators) to take the same ten percent investment tax credit currently available to employers only.",,,,,,

Stipulates that if plans offered by HMO's are not available, the employer must offer alternative plans which provide at least the minimum services required of a plan under this Act and under which the providers of services under the plan constitute a small enough percentage of the total number of providers of such services in the community so as to generate competition with other providers. <p>Requires each employer offering more than one health benefit plan to make an equal contribution for each employee regardless of which plan the employee chooses. <p>Stipulates that if the contribution amount selected by the employer is in excess of the total cost of any plan offered the employer shall contribute, to any employee choosing such plan, an amount equal to the difference between the employer contribution amount and the total cost of the plan chosen by the employer. <p>Stipulates that an amount contributed by an employer to a health benefit plan shall not be excluded from the gross income of the employee to the extent that such contribution exceeds the average cost for health benefit plans offered by HMO's.  Sets forth a method for determining such cost. <p>Requires each health benefit plan to provide that any individual covered under an employer's group health insurance plan may convert to an individual plan without regard to prior medical condition or proof of insurability. <p>Requires each health benefit plan to provide an employee the option to purchase coverage under the group plan for his or her spouse and dependent children. <p>Requires each health benefit plan to provide:  (1) physician services;  (2) inpatient and outpatient hospital services;  (3) medically necessary emergency services;  (4) short-term outpatient mental health services;  (5) medical treatment and referral services for the abuse of or addiction to alcohol or drugs;  (6) diagnostic laboratory and diagnostic and therapeutic radiologic services;  (7) home health services;  and (8) specified preventive health services. Requires each plan to provide for payment of the entire cost of the services included in the plan which are incurred after the out-of-pocket expenses for such services have reached $3,500 for an individual, spouse, and dependents in any calendar year. <p>Sets forth requirements for health insurance carriers under this Act.  States that the reasonable premium rate for a health benefit plan shall be determined by the appropriate State agency in accordance with standards established by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. <p>Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that contributions by an employer to accident plans, dental plans, and health plans for compensation to his or her employees shall not be included in gross income provided the plan meets the requirements of this Act.  Authorizes an employee to deduct his or her payments for health insurance under title XXI. <p>Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to revise provisions relating to payments and contractual arrangements with HMO's under the Medicare program.  Directs the Secretary to annually determine a per capita rate of payment for each class of individuals entitled to benefits under such program who are enrolled with a HMO or a health benefit plan with which the Secretary has contracted under the Medicare program.  Directs the Secretary to define appropriate classes based on such factors as age, sex, institutional status, disability status, and place of residence.  States that the rate for each class shall be equal to 95 percent of the ""adjusted average per capita cost"" for each class.  Defines the term ""adjusted average per capita cost"" to mean the average per capita amount that the Secretary estimates would be payable for services furnished under the Medicare program, if the services were furnished by other than a HMO or a health benefit plan.  Provides that every individual entitled to benefits under parts A (Hospital Insurance) and B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII or part B only shall be eligible to enroll with a HMO with which the Secretary has contracted to provide services.  Sets limits on a HMO's premium rate and the actuarial value of its other charges for individuals enrolled pursuant to this Act.  Defines the term ""health benefit plan"" to mean a nongovernmental organization which provides or pays for the cost of health services under group insurance policies, medical or hospital service agreements, membership or subscription contracts, or similar group arrangements, in consideration of premiums or other periodic charges payable to the plan, but does not include a HMO.",,,,,,

Rept. 96- 919) <p> Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1980 - Enacts into law the short titles ""Civil Rights Act of 1968"" and ""Fair Housing Act"". <p>  Amends the Fair Housing Act to expand the definition of ""discriminatory housing practice"" to include any violation under such Act (thus codifying case law which holds that the obligation of Federal agencies to administer programs affirmatively to further the purposes of fair housing and the prohibition against interference with rights under the Act are separately actionable). <p>  Adds new definitions of ""handicap"" and ""aggrieved person"".  Excludes from the meaning of ""handicap"" any impairment consisting of alcohol or drug abuse or which would be a direct threat to the property or safety of others. <p>  Defines ""aggrieved person"", for the purposes of obtaining enforcement by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as a person whose bona fide attempt to buy, sell, or finance a dwelling has been denied on a discriminatory basis. <p>  Retains the two current exemptions from the prohibition against the discriminatory sale or rental of housing which are given to:  (1) an owner of three or less single-family houses; and (2) the owner of a dwelling consisting of four or fewer family units who also resides in such dwelling (the ""Mrs. Murphy"" exemption). <p>  Makes it unlawful to:  (1) refuse to sell or rent to a handicapped person unless such handicap would prevent a prospective occupant from conforming to specified non-discrimination rules and practices; and (2) discriminate against a handicapped person in the conditions of sale or rental, or in the provision of related services or facilities.  Includes within such discrimination a refusal to:  (1) permit reasonable modifications to permit access to the premises (but only if a renter agrees to restore the premises to their original condition); and (2) make reasonable accommodations in policies, services, or facilities to afford handicapped persons equal enjoyment of the premises.  Stipulates that such discrimination shall not include a refusal to: (1) make alterations at the expense of sellers, landlords, owners, or persons acting on their behalf; (2) make modifications which would unreasonably inconvenience others; and (3) allow architectural modifications which materially decrease the value of a building or alter its intended use. <p>  Adds handicapped persons as a protected class under other existing prohibitions on discriminatory activities. <p>  Modifies the housing financing discrimination provision to prescribe all conduct which denies or ""otherwise makes unavailable"" financial assistance because of race, color, religion, handicap, or national origin. Includes with such prohibition persons in the business of selling, brokering, or appraising real property. <p>  Stipulates that it is not a violation of title VIII for real property appraisers to take into consideration all factors relevant to estimating fair market value, provided that such factors are not used for the purpose of discrimination. <p>  Expands the exemption provision to permit a minimum lot size requirement unless it is imposed with intent to discriminate against a protected class. <p>  Establishes the Fair Housing Commission, composed of three members appointed by the President for staggered six-year terms.  Stipulates that no more than two members may be of the same political party. <p>  Directs the Commission to:  (1) appoint administrative law judges and other employees as necessary to carry out its functions; (2) promulgate a code of ethics to assure the independence of such judges; (3) promulgate rules of discovery for its proceedings consistent insofar as practicable with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and (4) establish an appeals panel to review the proposed orders of the administrative law judges upon application of a party. <p>  Includes Federal agencies having regulatory authority over financial institutions within the executive departments and agencies which are currently required to administer their housing programs in an affirmative manner. <p>  Authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide financial as well as technical assistance to public and private organizations seeking to remedy housing discrimination. <p>  Establishes a new administrative enforce procedure within the Department of Housing and Urban Development in addition to the current enforcement provisions of title VIII (allowing civil actions by private parties and the Attorney General). <p>  Directs the Secretary to make an investigation of all alleged discriminatory housing practice on his or her own initiative or upon the filing of a charge by an aggrieved person within one year of the alleged discrimination.  Requires the Secretary to attempt to correct the discriminatory practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. Requires the Secretary, if the aggrieved person and respondent consent to binding arbitration, to refer the charge to an arbitrator made available by the Community Relations Service of the Department of Justice. <p>  Continues the current authority of the Secretary to utilize discovery measures.  Retains the current penalty for failing to produce information (up to a $1,000 fine and/or one year's imprisonment). <p>  Makes certain changes in the current requirements for referring charges to State or local agencies for investigation and enforcement.  Specifies, with respect to the rights and remedies provided by such agencies, the elements of ""substantial equivalency"" which permits certification and referrals of discrimination charges.  Eliminates the Secretary's authority to recall referrals in the interest of justice or to protect the rights of the parties.  Prohibits further action by the Secretary unless the agency fails to act in a timely fashion (current law gives the agency 30 days to commence proceedings). <p>  Requires the Secretary and other Federal agencies to cooperate to avoid duplication of their housing discrimination authority. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements to permit other agencies to carry out such responsibilities within their jurisdictions.  Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with specified Federal agencies for such purpose with respect to depository institutions. <p>  Permits an action for temporary or preliminary relief to be brought on behalf of the Secretary in accordance with rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when the Secretary establishes that voluntary compliance is unobtainable and prompt judicial action is necessary. <p>  Permits the Secretary to file an administrative complaint or refer the matter to the Attorney General for civil action if the investigation supports a finding of reasonable cause, except with respect to matters involving land use controls, which must be referred. <p>  Specifies the hearing procedures to be utilized if an administrative complaint is issued.  Permits the administrative law judge to award appropriate relief and a civil penalty of up to $10,000. <p>  Permits the filing of a position for judicial review of a final order in an appropriate court of appeals within 60 days after entry of such order. Provides that the findings of fact shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.  Stipulates that the reviewing court:  (1) shall not generally presume to be valid any rule or regulation issued by the Secretary; and (2) shall require that statutory authority have been granted expressly or by clear implication if such authority of the Secretary or the Commission is challenged. <p>  Authorizes the administrative law judge to assess civil penalties for noncompliance with a final administrative order. <p>  Makes certain revisions in the private right of action for aggrieved persons under the Fair Housing Act.  Extends the statute of limitations from 180 days to two years.  Disallows simultaneous administrative and judicial proceedings involving the same charge. Permits the Attorney General to intervene upon certification that the civil action is of general public importance.  Continues the current provision permitting the appointment of counsel.  Removes the existing $1,000 limit on punitive damages for willful violations. <p>  Continues the authority of the Attorney General to initiate civil actions where there is reasonable cause to believe that a pattern or practice of resistance to title VIII rights has occurred.  Permits the intervention of aggrieved persons in such actions. <p>  Permits the award of costs, including reasonable attorney fees, to prevailing parties in court and administrative proceedings (current law permits an award of attorney's fees only to prevailing parties who are financially unable to assume them). <p>  Directs the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board to report to Congress on the need for and cost of retrofitting housing for handicapped persons. <p>  Authorizes appropriations for this Act, effective October 1, 1981.",,,,,,
