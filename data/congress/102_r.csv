Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing. <p>Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must provide beyond a reasonable doubt. <p>Sets forth special aggravating factors for:  (1) treason, espionage, homicide, and the attempted murder of the President; and (2) drug offenses punishable by the death penalty (such factors include conviction for two felony drug offenses, conviction for serious Federal drug offenses, and participation in a continuing criminal enterprise involving drug sales to minors).  Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to recommend whether a sentence of death shall be imposed rather than a lesser sentence based upon a consideration of whether all the aggravating factors sufficiently outweigh all mitigating factors (or, in the absence of a mitigating factor, whether the aggravating factors alone are sufficient to justify such sentence).  Specifies that the jury or the court is never required to impose a death sentence. <p>States that no person who was under 17 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. <p>Requires the court to instruct the jury not to consider the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or victim in its consideration of the sentence. <p>Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence.  Requires the court of appeals to address all substantive and procedural issues raised on appeal and to consider whether the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor and whether the evidence supports the special finding of the existence of an aggravating factor required to be considered.  Directs the court to remand the case for reconsideration or imposition of a sentence other than death whenever it finds that: (1) the sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; (2) the admissible evidence and information adduced does not support the special finding of the existence of the required aggravating factor; or (3) the proceedings involved any other legal error requiring reversal of the sentence that was properly preserved for and raised on appeal. Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. <p>Sets forth procedures for the implementation of a sentence of death. <p>Prohibits a sentence of death from being carried out upon a person who is mentally retarded, who lacks the mental capacity to understand the death penalty and why it was imposed on that person, or upon a woman while she is pregnant. <p>Prohibits requiring any employee of any State department of corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals Service, or any employee providing services to that department, bureau, or service under contract to be in attendance or to participate in any execution if such participation is contrary to such employee's moral or religious convictions. <p>Limits the circumstances under which a person subject to the criminal jurisdiction of an Indian tribal government may be executed under this Act. <p>Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for specified Federal crimes, including:  (1) murders committed by prisoners in Federal correctional institutions; (2) civil rights murders and certain murders involving damage to religious property or obstruction of persons in the free exercise of religious beliefs; (3) murders through the use of a firearm, where a person causes the death of another intentionally, knowingly, through recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to human life, or through the intentional infliction of serious bodily injury; and (4) drug-related murders in the District of Columbia. <p><b>Title II:  Death Penalty or Life Imprisonment Without Parole for First Degree Murder in the District of Columbia</b> - Amends the D.C. Code to authorize the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole for first-degree murders in the District of Columbia. <p><b>Title III:  Habeas Corpus Reform</b> - <b>Subtitle A:  General Habeas Corpus Reform</b> - Habeas Corpus Reform Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal judicial code to establish a one-year statute of limitations for habeas corpus actions brought by State prisoners. <p>Vests authority to issue certificates for probable cause for appeal of habeas corpus orders exclusively in the courts of appeals. <p>Permits denial on the merits of habeas corpus writs notwithstanding the failure to exhaust State remedies. <p>Prohibits the granting of a petition for habeas corpus with respect to any claim which has been fully and fairly adjudicated in State proceedings.  Sets forth provisions with respect to the appointment of counsel. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Death Penalty Litigation Procedures</b> - Death Penalty Litigation Procedures Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal judicial code to set forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases.  Applies such procedures to Federal habeas corpus cases brought by prisoners in State custody who are subject to a capital sentence.  Makes the applicability of such procedures contingent upon a State establishing a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners whose capital convictions and sentences have been upheld on direct appeal to the court of last resort in the State or have otherwise become final for State law purposes.  States that the rule of court on statutes establishing such mechanism must provide standards of competency for the appointment of such counsel. <p>Specifies that any such mechanism shall offer counsel to all State prisoners under capital sentence and provide for the entry of an order by a court of record that:  (1) appoints counsel to represent the prisoner upon a specified finding; (2) finds that the prisoner has rejected the offer of counsel and made the decision with an understanding of its legal consequences; or (3) denies the appointment of counsel upon a finding that the prisoner is not indigent. <p>Provides for a mandatory stay of execution during the post-conviction review initiated pursuant to this Act.  Details conditions which will cause such stay to expire.  Prohibits a Federal court, if one of such conditions has occurred, from entering a stay of execution or granting relief in a capital case unless:  (1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not previously presented in the State or Federal courts; (2) the failure to raise the claim was the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, was the result of a recognition by the Supreme Court of a new Federal right that is retroactively applicable, or is due to the fact that the claim is based on facts that could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review; and (3) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt of the offense for which the death penalty was imposed. <p>Imposes time limits on filing for habeas corpus relief.  Requires such time limits to be tolled under specified conditions. <p>Requires the district court, upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, to rule on the merits of the claims properly before it.  Makes the requirement for a certificate of probable cause inapplicable, with exceptions, where:  (1) a second or successive petition is filed; and (2) certain requirements under a unitary review procedure (i.e., a State procedure that authorizes a person under sentence of death to raise, in the course of direct review of judgment, such claims as could be raised on collateral attack) are met. <p>Sets forth time limits for determining petitions.  Specifies that the adjudication of petitions or motions involving habeas corpus in capital cases shall be granted priority by the district court and court of appeals over all noncapital matters.  Directs the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to report annually to the Congress on court compliance with the time limits established under this subtitle. <p><b>Title IV:  Exclusionary Rule</b> - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure shall not be excluded in a court of the United States as being in violation of the fourth amendment to the U.S.  Constitution if such search or seizure was carried out in circumstances justifying an objectively reasonable belief that it was in conformity with the fourth amendment.  Makes the fact that evidence was obtained pursuant to and within the scope of a warrant prima facie evidence of the existence of such circumstances. <p>Specifies that Federal law does not require the exclusion of evidence in State court proceedings under circumstances in which such evidence would be admissible in a Federal court proceeding.",,,,,,

Commends the USTR for including the Arab boycott in the 1992 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Barriers, but urges expansion of such report to:  (1) include country-by-country analysis on the extent to which each government permits companies in its country to comply with the secondary Arab boycott of U.S. companies; (2) identify the activities of specific governments to enforce the boycott; and (3) discuss the differences in how countries blacklist companies and enforce the boycott. <p><b>Chapter 2 - Import Sanctions to Control Nuclear Proliferation</b> - Omnibus Nuclear Proliferation Control Act of 1992 - Requires the President to impose sanctions upon any foreign person that has materially and with requisite knowledge contributed, through the exports of goods or technology, to the efforts by any individual, group, or non-nuclear weapon state to acquire unsafeguarded special nuclear material or to use, develop, stockpile, or acquire any nuclear explosive device.  Prohibits the importation into the United States of products produced by such foreign person or any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or successor entity.  Sets forth specified exceptions. <p> Urges the President to initiate consultations with foreign governments with jurisdiction over such foreign persons with respect to the imposition of the sanctions.

(Currently, there is no such deadline for completion of such a review.) <p>Requires the ITC to consider contracts with long lead time as a factor when making material injury determinations with respect to an affected domestic industry in countervailing and antidumping duty investigations.  Declares that the presence or absence of any factor the ITC is required to consider shall not give decisive guidance with respect to any threat of material injury determinations. <p>Provides that, with respect to the determination of foreign market value of imported merchandise under investigation, no allowance shall be made to account for differences in input costs that are based on whether the end product made from the input is sold in the home market or exported. <p>Requires the United States Customs Service to report annually to the administering authority on the amount of duties collected during each year under each countervailing and antidumping duty order. Requires the administering authority to make such data available to interested parties. <p>Requires the administering authority, when determining whether imported parts or components are circumventing an antidumping or countervailing duty order or finding, and whether to include such parts or components in such order or finding, to consider:  (1) the pattern of trade; (2) the value and sources of supply of parts or components historically used in completion or assembly of the merchandise subject to such order; (3) whether the manufacturer or exporter of such parts or components is related to the person who assembles or completes the merchandise sold in the United States from the parts or components produced in the foreign country with respect to which the order or finding applies; and (4) whether imports into the United States of the parts or components produced in such foreign country have increased after the issuance of such order or finding. <p>Authorizes the administering authority to include within the scope of such order or finding imported parts or components that are used in the completion or assembly of certain merchandise sold in the United States and subject to such order or finding, provided:  (1) such merchandise is completed or assembled in the United States from parts or components supplied by the exporter or producer with respect to which such order or finding applies, from suppliers that have historically supplied the parts or components to that exporter or producer, or from any party in the exporting country supplying parts or components on behalf of such exporter or producer; (2) the value of such imported parts and components is significant in relation to the total value of all parts and components used in the assembly or completion operation, excluding packing, of the imported merchandise covered by such order or finding; or (3) consideration of specified factors establishes a pattern of circumvention of a countervailing and antidumping duty order or finding.  Enables the administering authority to base such a decision on any of such factors by itself, rather than on all of them together.  Sets forth similar provisions for merchandise completed or assembled in other foreign countries. <p>Directs the Secretary of Commerce and the ITC to study and report to the Congress on modification of standards applicable to the initiation of countervailing and antidumping duty actions in order to make petitioning for such initiations less costly and more accessible for domestic petitioners. <p>Requires the USTR to report to the Congress on the operation of the Agreement Concerning the Application of the GATT Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft between the United States and the European Community. <p>Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should not enter into any international trade agreement on antidumping requiring changes in U.S. antidumping laws that would reduce the effectiveness of such laws as a remedy against injurious dumped imports.  Urges the President to review antidumping provisions contained in the Draft Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations dated December 21, 1991, and seek changes to strengthen the effectiveness of U.S. antidumping laws, including, but not limited to, changes in provisions dealing with cumulation of injury and dispute settlement. <p>Expresses the sense of the Congress that the U.S.  Government should not condone the use by foreign governments of trade distorting subsidies, including development subsidies, that cause material injury to U.S. industries. <p>Requires the administering authority in antidumping proceedings involving merchandise from a nonmarket economy country to determine, if certain conditions exist, the foreign market value of such merchandise on the basis of the value of all factors of production in such country, if such information is available. <p>Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to revise factors used by the ITC for purposes of material injury determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations. <p>Requires the ITC, in determining whether a U.S. industry is threatened with material injury from imports, to consider, among other factors, the:  (1) actual and potential decline in order backlog of the domestic industry; and (2) monthly and quarterly trend information through the month of the filing of the antidumping duty petition. <p>Amends the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (OTCA), with respect to principal trade negotiating objectives, to declare that dispute settlement mechanisms and procedures, with respect to review of countervailing duty and antidumping duty actions taken by a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, shall not allow review of certain issues in certain procedural circumstances. <p>Applies certain OTCA provisions only to antidumping and countervailing duty reviews initiated with respect to merchandise which:  (1) is the product of a party-country to a free trade agreement entered into force and effect before January 1, 1987; and (2) was the subject of an investigation initiated on or after enactment of the United States - Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. <p>Amends Federal law to revise the prohibition against the dumping of articles into the United States to prohibit a person from importing or selling within the United States articles manufactured in a foreign country if:  (1) such articles are imported or sold at a U.S. price less than the foreign market value or constructed value of the article; and (2) the importation or sale causes or threatens material injury to U.S. industry or labor, or prevents, in whole or in part, the establishment or modernization of any U.S.  industry.  (Removes the requirement of a specific intent to do such harm.)  Authorizes an interested party whose business or property is injured by such importation or sale to bring a civil action in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Court of International Trade.  Sets forth guidelines for such civil actions.  Expresses the sense of the Congress that this is consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). <p><b>Subtitle C:  Extension of Steel Stabilization Act</b> - Specialty Steel Voluntary Restraint Agreement Extension Act - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should extend the specialty steel voluntary restraint agreement program for three more years. <p>Amends the Steel Import Stabilization Act to extend it through March 31, 1995, unless the President submits a specified affirmative determination to specified congressional committees.",,,,,,

Establishes special rules for such investments.  Provides for determining the maximum capital gains rate for small business net capital gain or seed capital gain.  Treats capital gains on the sale of such stock as a preference item for purposes of the minimum tax. <p><b>Title IV:  Health Care Provisions</b> - <b>Subtitle A:  Small Business Purchasing Groups</b> - Defines a ""qualified small employer purchasing group,"" for purposes of this subtitle, as an entity that the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines:  (1) is administered solely under authority and control of its member employers; (2) has as its membership solely small employers; (3) with respect to each State in which its members are located, consists of no fewer than 100 employers; (4) has member employers whose health care insurance plans are in compliance with applicable State law and model benefits plans and are not self-insured plans; (5) will be a nonprofit entity; and (6) has a board of directors with full authority to act on the part of the group. <p>Directs the board of directors of the small employer purchasing group to:  (1) establish geographic areas within which participating carriers may offer health care insurance coverage to eligible employees and dependents; and (2) enter into contracts with qualified carriers for providing health insurance coverage to eligible employees and dependents, and to pay such carriers on at least a monthly basis at the contracted rates.  Outlines provisions relating to:  (1) general qualifications of carriers, including financial solvency; (2) program standards, including review of the quality and appropriateness of care covered; (3) uniformity of benefits; (4) the collection of insurance premiums from small employers; (5) notification from the board to employers of the availability of sponsored health insurance coverage from the program; and (6) conditions of participation in the program, including a requirement that an entity is a valid small employer and not formed solely to secure health insurance coverage. <p>Finds that qualified small employer purchasing groups organized to obtain health insurance for its employer members affect interstate commerce, and that no State law shall preempt provisions of the model benefit health insurance plan as outlined above.  Amends the Internal Revenue Code to define the amount of the employer health insurance credit for a taxable year for Federal income tax purposes.  Prohibits the taking of both a credit and a deduction for health insurance premiums paid under the model plan. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Deductible Health Insurance Costs for Self-Employed Individuals</b> - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase from 25 to 100 percent the allowable deduction of health insurance costs for self-employed individuals and their spouses and dependents.  Makes such increased deduction permanent (currently ends December 31, 1992). <p><b>Subtitle C:  Improvements in Health Insurance for Small Employers</b> - Adds a new Title XXI to the Social Security Act entitled ""Standards for Small Employer Health Insurance and Certification of Managed Care Plans.""  Treats as meeting the requirements of title XXI an insurer offering a health insurance plan to a small employer in a State on or after January 1, 1994, if:  (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that the State has established a regulatory program that provides for the application and enforcement of appropriate requirements under this title; and (2) the State has not established such a program or if the program has been decertified by the Secretary, the health plan has been certified by the Secretary as meeting the requirements of part B of title XXI.  Provides an extension of the date by which a regulatory program must be adopted by a State for States requiring legislation to be passed and which has a legislature which does not meet in 1993 in a legislative session.  States that requirements under title XXI shall not apply to pre-existing health insurance plans. Requires each State to report to the Secretary on the implementation and enforcement of standards with respect to health insurance plans offered to small employers.  Allows State standards more stringent than the requirements of title XXI. <p>Directs the Secretary to require the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to:  (1) develop specific standards for small employer health insurance plans; and (2) report to the Secretary on implementation.  Directs the Secretary to develop appropriate standards if the NAIC fails to do so.  Requires such standards to provide alternative standards for guaranteeing the availability of health insurance plans for all small employers in a State.  Directs the Secretary to periodically review State regulatory programs, allow a State to adopt a plan of correction if necessary, and to decertify a State program and assume program responsibility, if necessary.  Directs the Comptroller General to periodically audit sample State regulatory programs.  Defines a ""small employer"" for purposes of title XXI as an employer who employs more than one but less than 51 employees on a typical business day. <p>Requires each health insurer to register with the applicable regulatory authority for each State in which it issues or offers a health insurance plan to small employers.  Prohibits such insurer from excluding any eligible employee, or their spouse or dependent, under a plan, with the exception of waiting periods required generally under health insurance coverage.  Requires insurers offering a health insurance plan to small employers in a State to meet the standards for such insurance adopted by such State.  Outlines provisions concerning: (1) State standards on the guaranteed availability of small employer health insurance; (2) the State adoption of a regulatory program for such standards; (3) standards for guaranteed insurance availability for States not adopting such standards; (4) appropriate grounds for refusal by an insurer to renew, and for termination of, a health insurance plan (including nonpayment of premiums, fraud or misrepresentation, or failure to maintain minimum participation rates); (5) authority of an insurer to require minimum participation rates; (6) guaranteed renewability of such insurance unless reasons enumerated in (4), above, occur; (7) nonrenewability of health insurance by an insurer who elects to terminate all of the health insurance plans issued to small employers in a State; and (8) a prohibition against an insurer denying, limiting, or conditioning health insurance coverage based on health status, claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, or lack of evidence of insurability of an individual.  Allows a plan offered to a small employer under this title to exclude coverage with respect to a preexisting condition, but limits the period of such exclusion to six months.  Reduces such authorized preexisting condition exclusionary period by one month for each month in which an individual was already in a plan of continuous coverage with respect to particular services on the date of initial coverage of the new plan. <p>Prohibits the base premium rate charged by an insurer for any block of business (all of the small employers within a health insurance plan issued by the insurer) from exceeding by more than 20 percent the base premium rate charged for any other block of business, with exceptions. Limits similarly the variation of rates charged during a rating period to small employers within the same block of business of an insurer when such employers have similar demographic characteristics. <p>Provides that, in establishing premium rates for health insurance plans offered to small employers:  (1) an insurer making adjustments with respect to age, sex, or geography must apply such adjustments consistently across all small employers; and (2) no insurer may use a geographic area smaller than a county or a certain zip code area. Places limitations on the transfer by an insurer of employers among blocks of business, requiring employer consent.  Limits to five percent over the base premium rate the percentage increase in the premium rate authorized to be charged to a small employer for a new rating period.  Requires an insurer, at the time of offering a health insurance plan to a small employer, to fully disclose specified information relating to the insurer's rating practices with respect to small employers under a plan, and the insurer's right to change premium rates.  Requires at least 60 days' prior notice of the renewal terms of a plan about to expire.  Requires each participating insurer to file with the applicable regulatory authority a written actuarial certification of insurer compliance with standards and requirements of this title. <p>Outlines the basic medical benefits which must be included in a benefits package offered by an insurer to small employers in a State as part of the health insurance plan.  Requires such insurer to offer a managed care plan to such small employers if the insurer offers a managed care plan in such State to employers that are not small employers.  Provides for cost sharing (premiums, deductibles, copayments) and out-of-pocket limits for health insurance plans containing basic benefit packages.  Preempts State-mandated benefit packages in favor of the benefits package described in the small employer health insurance plan. <p>Amends the Internal Revenue Code relating to taxes on group health plans to impose upon any person issuing a health insurance plan to a small employer a tax on the failure to meet at any time the applicable requirements of title XXI of the Social Security Act (as added by this Act).  Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine whether a person meets such requirements.  States that such tax shall be 25 percent of the gross premiums on health insurance plans issued to a small employer during a taxable year.  Treats corporations which are members of the same controlled group of corporations as one person for purposes of such tax, as well as partnerships and proprietorships under common control.  Waives the application of such tax where the failure to meet such requirements:  (1) could not have reasonably been discovered; and (2) is corrected within 30 days of discovery.  Allows the Secretary to waive all or part of such tax in the case of a failure due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.  Makes nondeductible for income tax purposes any tax so imposed. <p>Direct the Comptroller General to study and report to the Congress on the standards for rating practices and the requirements for benefit packages established under the new title XXI of the Social Security Act, as well as on certain other aspects of insurance offered to small employers under this Act.  Requires the Comptroller General to include as part of such report any recommendations for adjusting rating standards under title XXI to eliminate variation in premiums. <p><b>Subtitle D:  Improvements in Portability of Private Health Insurance</b> - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax on any person or group health plan that fails to satisfy the preexisting condition requirements of group health insurance plans as enumerated under title XXI of the Social Security Act.  Makes such tax $100 for each day of noncompliance.  Outlines actions to be taken in order for a failed requirement to be considered corrected.  Waives the application of such excise tax where the failure to meet such requirements:  (1) could not have reasonably been discovered; and (2) is corrected within 30 days of discovery.  Allows the Secretary to waive all or part of such tax in the case of a failure due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.  States that group health plans:  (1) may not deny, limit, or condition coverage based on health status, claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, or lack of evidence of insurability of an individual; and (2) may exclude coverage with respect to the treatment of a preexisting condition, limiting the period of exclusion to six months.  Reduces such authorized preexisting condition exclusionary period by one month for each month in which an individual was already in a plan of continuous coverage with respect to particular services on the date of initial coverage in the group health plan.  Requires any person who had provided previous coverage during a period of continuous coverage with respect to a covered individual to disclose to the group health plan the coverage and benefits provided to such individual. <p><b>Subtitle E:  Health Care Cost Containment</b> - Amends title XXI of the Social Security Act to add a new Part entitled ""Federal Certification of Managed Care Plans.""  Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a process for certification of managed care plans and utilization review programs meeting the requirements of this Part.  Defines a ""utilization review program"" as a system of reviewing the medical necessity, appropriateness, or quality of health care services and supplies provided under a health insurance plan or a managed care plan using specified guidelines.  Defines a ""managed care plan"" as a plan operated by a managed care entity that provides for the financing and delivery of health care services to persons enrolled in such plan through:  (1) arrangements with selected providers; (2) explicit standards for the selection of participating providers; (3) organizational arrangements for ongoing quality assurance and utilization review programs; and (4) financial incentives for persons enrolled in the plan to use the participating providers and procedures provided for by the plan. Defines related terms.  Directs the Secretary to:  (1) establish procedures for the periodic review and recertification of qualified managed care plans and qualified utilization review programs; and (2) terminate such certification when such plan or program no longer meets the applicable requirements for certification.  Permits certification through the recognition of a State licensure program or national accreditation body that establishes requirements at least equivalent to the requirements under this part. <p>Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Health Care Cost Commission, to establish Federal standards for the certification of qualified managed care plans and qualified utilization review programs. Requires such standards to first be established within two years after enactment of this Subtitle.  Directs the Secretary to periodically review and update such standards, as appropriate.  Prohibits the imposition by State law or regulation of specified limitations and restrictions on qualified managed care plans and qualified utilization review programs, with exceptions. <p>Extends to January 1, 1992, the date by which the Administrator of Health Care Policy and Research must develop an initial set of guidelines and standards with respect to treatments and conditions that constitute a significant portion of national health expenditures. Directs the Administrator, in consultation with the National Institute of Mental Health and mental health providers, to develop outcomes research and practice parameters for mental health services, including diagnosis and treatment of childhood attention deficit syndrome disorders and manic depression.  Amends the Social Security Act with respect to research on outcomes of health care services to change from 70 to 50 percent of authorized FY 1993 and 1994 funds for such research the amount to be obtained from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. Increases the general authorization of FY 1992 through 1994 funds under such Act for such purpose. <p><b>Subtitle F:  Medical Liability Reform</b> - <b>Chapter 1:  Definitions and Findings</b> - Finds that the health care and insurance industries are industries affecting interstate commerce, and that the medical malpractice litigation system throughout the United States affects interstate commerce by contributing to the high cost of health care and premiums for malpractice insurance purchased by health care providers. <p><b>Chapter 2:  Expedited Medical Malpractice Settlements</b> - Allows any claimant to bring a civil action for damages for harm caused during the provision of medical care pursuant to applicable State law, except to the extent that such law is superseded by this Chapter. <p>Allows any claimant to file with the claim for damages a settlement offer for a specific amount.  Directs the defendant, within 60 days or the time permitted by State law to respond to pleadings, whichever is longer, to make a settlement offer of a specific amount, except that if such pleadings include a motion to dismiss under applicable State law, the defendant may tender such relief to the claimant within ten days after the determination of the court regarding such motion.  Provides for time extensions in certain cases.  Outlines procedures for the rejection of settlement offers by the claimant and defendant in such cases.  Provides for the calculation of attorney's fees in such cases by an hourly rate. <p><b>Chapter 3:  Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedures</b> - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an Alternative Dispute Resolution Board of Advisors to make recommendations to the Secretary concerning the establishment of a model voluntary alternative dispute resolution program (dispute program).  Directs the Secretary to approve a model dispute program submitted by the Board, with any modifications that the Secretary deems appropriate. <p>Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a program to encourage States to develop and implement voluntary alternative dispute resolution procedures that meet the requirements of this Subtitle.  Requires each State to adopt its own dispute program or the Federal program submitted by the Board to the Secretary within two years after enactment of this Act. <p>Provides that, with respect to a State that has a dispute program in effect, in lieu of or in addition to making a settlement offer a claimant or defendant may offer to proceed pursuant to the dispute program and its procedures.  Creates a rebuttable presumption that a refusal by an offeree to proceed under a dispute program was unreasonable or not in good faith if the verdict is rendered in favor of the offeror. <p><b>Chapter 4:  Uniform Standards for Medical Malpractice Cases</b> - Applies provisions of this chapter to any medical malpractice case brought in Federal or State court and any such case resolved through a dispute program.  Provides that in either such action, no person may be required to pay more than $100,000 in a single payment for future losses, but such person shall be permitted to make such payments on a periodic basis.  Limits in a civil medical malpractice action the total amount of damages that may be awarded for noneconomic losses resulting from an injury to $250,000, regardless of the number of health care professionals and providers against whom the claim is brought.  Reduces the total amount of damages received under such limits by any other payment that has been made to the injured individual (i.e., other insurance).  Places specified limits on attorney's fees authorized to be collected under Chapter 4 actions. <p>Provides that in either such action, the liability of each defendant for noneconomic damages shall be several only and not joint (requiring each such defendant to be liable only for their specific percentage of responsibility for the damages).  Provides a statute of limitations with respect to such cases.  Provides special medical malpractice liability provisions with respect to services provided during the delivery of a baby. <p><b>Chapter 5:  Uniform Disciplinary Reforms</b> - Requires a State to comply with requirements of this chapter within two years after enactment of this Act. <p>Directs each State to: (1) allocate the total amount of fees paid to the State in each year for the licensing or certification of each type of health care practitioner, or State funds equal to such amount, to the agencies responsible for the conduct of licensing and disciplinary actions with respect to such practitioners; and (2) permit the general public to be represented on State health care practitioner disciplinary boards.  Provides immunity from liability for any member, consultant, witness, or other individual serving or having served on such a disciplinary board for either the board's operation or duties performed in good faith. <p>Requires each State to have in effect within two years after enactment of this Act a Statewide risk management program to reduce the incidence of medical malpractice which meets any promulgated regulations.  Directs each State to establish a health care disciplinary trust fund to provide resources to disciplinary boards for their functions and to provide additional resources for State consumer protection activities. <p><b>Chapter 6:  Medical Products</b> - Provides that punitive damages otherwise permitted by law shall not be awarded in an action against a health care producer of a drug or device that caused the harm complained of if the drug or device:  (1) was subject to approval or premarket approval under applicable Federal regulations with respect to the safety of the formulation or performance of the drug or device, or the adequacy of the packaging or labeling of the drug or device; and (2) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); or (3) is generally recognized as safe and effective pursuant to conditions established by the FDA.  States that such provision shall not apply when the defendant:  (1) withheld from, or misrepresented to, the FDA or other Federal agency official material and relevant information as to the performance of the drug or device; or (2) made an illegal payment to an FDA official to secure approval of the drug or device.  Outlines provisions with respect to evidence, punitive damages, and positive defense to strict liability against the health care producers of the drug or device. <p><b>Subtitle G:  Uniform Claims Criteria</b> - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, after consultation with group health plan entities and health care providers, to develop uniform claims criteria for use by beneficiaries and health care providers in submitting claims under this Act and under title XXI of the Social Security Act.

Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on the panel's findings and recommendations. <p>Expresses the sense of the Congress that each Federal agency that issues rules, regulations, or orders which affect small business concerns or otherwise has some relationship with or affects small business should appoint one individual to serve as a small business ombudsman for that agency.  Requires such ombudsman to represent the issues of small business to such agency, assist in the arbitration of disputes between agencies and small business concerns, and make certain reports to the Congress and the SBA Administrator. <p>Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA should be permitted to appear as amicus curiae (friend of the court) in any action or case brought in a U.S. court for the purpose of reviewing a rule.",,,,,,

Permits the Government to present information concerning the effect of the offense on the victim and the victim's family, including oral testimony, a victim impact statement, and other relevant information. <p>Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must provide beyond a reasonable doubt. <p>Sets forth special aggravating factors for:  (1) treason, espionage, homicide, and the attempted murder of the President; and (2) drug offenses punishable by the death penalty (such factors include previous serious drug felony convictions, use of a firearm in committing or furthering certain continuing criminal enterprises, use of minors in trafficking, and lethal adulteration of controlled substances).  Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to recommend the death penalty upon a finding of at least one aggravating factor and no mitigating factor, or one or more aggravating factors which outweigh any mitigating factors. <p>States that no person who was under 18 years of age at the time of the offense or who is mentally retarded may be sentenced to death. <p>Requires the court to instruct the jury not to consider the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of the defendant or victim in its consideration of the sentence. <p>Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence.  Requires the court of appeals, upon consideration of the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if:  (1) the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors; and (3) the proceedings did not involve any other prejudicial error requiring reversal of the sentence that was properly preserved for and raised on appeal. Specifies that the court of appeals, in a case in which the sentence is not affirmed, shall remand the case for reconsideration or for imposition of another authorized sentence as appropriate, subject to specified requirements.  Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. <p>Sets forth procedures for the implementation of a sentence of death. <p>Prohibits a sentence of death from being carried out upon a person who lacks the mental capacity to understand the death penalty and why it was imposed on that person, or upon a woman while she is pregnant. <p>Prohibits requiring any employee of any State department of corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), the U.S.  Marshals Service, or any employee providing services to that department, bureau, or service under contract to be in attendance or to participate in any execution if such participation is contrary to such employee's moral or religious convictions. <p>Provides for the appointment of counsel in Federal cases where a defendant against whom a sentence of death is sought, or on whom such sentence has been imposed, for an offense against the United States, is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation. <p>Sets forth additional provisions with respect to:  (1) representation before and after review of judgment; (2) standards for competence of counsel; and (3) claims of ineffectiveness of counsel. <p>Sets forth provisions regarding:  (1) deadlines for collateral attacks on judgments imposing a sentence of death; and (2) stays of execution. <p>Limits the circumstances under which a person subject to the criminal jurisdiction of an Indian tribal government may be executed under this Act. <p>Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for specified Federal crimes, including:  (1) treason; (2) delivering defense information to aid a foreign government; (3) specified Controlled Substances Act (CSA) offenses committed as part of a continuing criminal enterprise; (4) certain felony violations of the CSA, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (CSIEA), or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act; (5) murders committed by prisoners in Federal correctional institutions; (6) certain offenses relating to drive-by shootings; (7) kidnappings which result in the death of any person; (8) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (9) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (10) civil rights murders and certain murders involving damage to religious property or obstruction of persons in the free exercise of religious belief; (11) genocide; (12) murder of Federal law enforcement officers, or of State or local law enforcement officers assisting Federal officers; (13) torture, if death results; (14) murder of Federal witnesses in the Witness Protection Program; (15) gun murders during Federal crimes of violence and drug trafficking crimes; (16) rape and child molestation murders; (17) causing death in the sexual exploitation of children; (18) specified offenses under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (FAA); (19) using, or attempting or conspiring to use, a weapon of mass destruction, if death results; (20) first-degree murders involving the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon in a Federal facility; (21) murder by escaped prisoners; and (22) murders in the District of Columbia. <p>Increases penalties for obstruction of justice offenses against court officers and jurors, and for retaliatory killings of witnesses, victims, and informants. <p>Sets forth penalties for:  (1) performing or attempting an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation which causes or is likely to cause serious injury or death; (2) destroying or seriously damaging the facilities of, or a civil aircraft not in service at, such airport; or (3) disrupting the services of such airport, if such an act endangers or is likely to endanger safety. <p>Amends the FAA to delete a limitation on the applicability of aircraft piracy provisions to situations where the place of takeoff or of actual landing of the aircraft on board which the offense is committed is situated outside the territory of the State of registration of such aircraft. <p>Establishes penalties for acts of violence against maritime navigation, such as seizing control of a ship by force, threat, or intimidation, and performing acts of violence against persons on board a ship that are likely to endanger safe navigation.  Sets forth analogous provisions with respect to maritime fixed platforms. <p>Sets forth provisions with respect to U.S. jurisdiction over the territorial sea and over crimes against U.S. nationals on foreign vessels. <p><b>Title II:  Habeas Corpus Reform</b> - <b>Subtitle A:  General Habeas Corpus Reform</b> - Habeas Corpus Reform Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal judicial code to establish a one-year statute of limitations for habeas corpus actions brought by State prisoners. <p>Vests authority to issue certificates for probable cause for appeal of habeas corpus orders exclusively in the courts of appeals. <p>Permits denial on the merits of habeas corpus writs notwithstanding the failure to exhaust State remedies. <p>Prohibits the granting of a petition for habeas corpus with respect to any claim which has been fully and fairly adjudicated in State proceedings.  Sets forth provisions with respect to the appointment of counsel. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Death Penalty Litigation Procedures</b> - Death Penalty Litigation Procedures Act of 1992 - Amends the Federal judicial code to set forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases.  Applies such procedures to Federal habeas corpus cases brought by prisoners in State custody who are subject to a capital sentence.  Makes the applicability of such procedures contingent upon a State establishing a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners whose capital convictions and sentences have been upheld on direct appeal to the court of last resort in the State or have otherwise become final for State law purposes.  States that the rule of court on statutes establishing such mechanism must provide standards of competency for the appointment of such counsel. <p>Specifies that any such mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under capital sentence and must provide for the entry of an order by a court of record:  (1) appointing counsel to represent the prisoner upon a specified finding; (2) finding that the prisoner has rejected the offer of counsel and made the decision with an understanding of its legal consequences; or (3) denying the appointment of counsel upon a finding that the prisoner is not indigent. <p>Provides for a mandatory stay of execution during the post-conviction review initiated pursuant to this Act.  Details conditions which will cause such stay to expire.  Prohibits a Federal court, if one of such conditions has occurred, from entering a stay of execution or granting relief in a capital case unless:  (1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not previously presented in the State or Federal courts; (2) the failure to raise the claim was the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, was the result of a recognition by the Supreme Court of a new Federal right that is retroactively applicable, or is due to the fact that the claim is based on facts that could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review; and (3) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt of the offense for which the death penalty was imposed. <p>Imposes time limits on filing for habeas corpus relief.  Requires such time limits to be tolled under specified conditions. <p>Requires the district court, upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, to rule on the merits of the claims properly before it.  Makes the requirement for a certificate of probable cause inapplicable, with exceptions, where:  (1) a second or successive petition is filed; and (2) certain requirements under a unitary review procedure (i.e., a State procedure that authorizes a person under sentence of death to raise, in the course of direct review of judgment, such claims as could be raised on collateral attack) are met. <p>Sets forth time limits for determining petitions.  Specifies that the adjudication of petitions or motions involving habeas corpus in capital cases shall be granted priority by the district court and court of appeals over all noncapital matters. Directs the Administrative Office of U.S.  Courts to report annually to the Congress on court compliance with the time limits established under this subtitle. <p><b>Subtitle C:  Equalization of Capital Habeas Corpus Litigation Funding</b> - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Omnibus Act) to require the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to provide grants to the States to support litigation pertaining to Federal habeas corpus petitions in capital cases.  Specifies that the total funding available for such grants within any fiscal year shall be equal to the funding provided to capital resource centers, pursuant to Federal appropriation, in the same fiscal year. <p><b>Title III:  Exclusionary Rule</b> - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure shall not be excluded in a court of the United States as being in violation of the fourth amendment to the U.S.  Constitution if such search or seizure was carried out in circumstances justifying an objectively reasonable belief that it was in conformity with the fourth amendment.  Makes the fact that evidence was obtained pursuant to and within the scope of a warrant prima facie evidence of the existence of such circumstances. <p>Bars the exclusion of evidence in such a proceeding on the ground that it was obtained in violation of a statute, administrative rule or regulation, or rule of procedure unless exclusion is expressly authorized by statute or by rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. <p><b>Title IV:  Firearms and Related Amendments</b> - Revises firearms-related provisions to establish the following penalties, in addition to the punishment provided for the underlying crime, for engaging in specified activities during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime for which the perpetrator may be prosecuted in a State court.  Provides that whoever: <p>(1) knowingly uses, carries, or otherwise possesses a firearm shall be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years; (2) discharges a firearm with intent to injure another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years; or (3) knowingly uses, carries, or otherwise possesses a firearm that is a machine gun or destructive device or is equipped with a firearm silencer or muffler shall be sentenced to imprisonment for 30 years.  Sets penalties for second, third, and subsequent convictions.  Specifies that a term of imprisonment under such provision shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed for the underlying crime. <p>Sets forth penalties for smuggling firearms in aid of drug trafficking and for theft of firearms and explosives. <p>Increases penalties for making knowingly false, material statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm from a licensed dealer. <p>Authorizes the summary destruction of explosives subject to forfeiture under specified circumstances.

Specifies that such fees shall be paid by the nonprevailing party up to the amount of such fees of the nonprevailing party or, if the nonprevailing party receives services under a contingent fee agreement, the reasonable value of such services. <p>Requires the counsel of record in any such action, in order to receive attorney fees, to maintain accurate, complete records of hours worked on the matter regardless of the fee arrangement. Authorizes the court to limit fees recovered to the extent that it finds special circumstances that make payment of such fees unjust. <p>Makes provisions of this Act (with respect to attorney fees in diversity cases) inapplicable to actions removed from State court or in which the United States, any State, or any agency, officer, or employee thereof is a party. <p>Amends the Equal Access to Justice Act to bar the award of attorney fees in excess of $75 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living, as reflected by the change in the CPI-U (currently, unless the court determines that such an increase, or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved) justifies a higher fee.  Sets forth provisions for the calculation of such cost of living adjustment. <p>Amends the Federal judicial code to require a claimant or potential plaintiff or plaintiffs, at least 30 days before filing suit in a civil action brought in a U.S. district court, to transmit written notice to the intended defendant or defendants at an address reasonably calculated to provide actual notice of the specific claims involved, including the amount of actual damages and expenses.  Directs such claimant, at the commencement of the action, to file in such court a certificate of service evidencing compliance with such provision. Provides for a 30-day extension of any applicable statute of limitations that would expire during the period of such notice.  Makes the requirements of this provision inapplicable under specified circumstances, such as in bankruptcy proceedings and where a defendant or assets are subject to flight. <p>Specifies that in the event that the district court finds that such notice requirements have not been met by the claimant, and such defect is asserted by the defendant within 60 days after service of the summons or complaint, the claim shall be dismissed without prejudice and the costs of such action, including attorney fees, shall be imposed upon the claimant.  Permits the claimant, under such circumstances, to refile such claim within 60 days after dismissal regardless of any statutory limitations period if, during the 60 days after dismissal, notice is transmitted as provided by this Act and the original action was timely filed. <p>Authorizes the United States, except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, to enter into an agreement which provides that attorney fees may be awarded against the United States or any other party to the action or proceeding:  (1) in any civil action commenced by the United States; (2) in civil proceedings involving disputes pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978; or (3) in a case in which the United States and another party have agreed to use outcome-determinative mediation, subject to specified requirements. Sets forth further requirements with respect to the award of attorney fees, including the handling of such awards received by Federal agencies. <p>Directs:  (1) the chief judge of each judicial circuit (other than the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit) to designate one district court to be a pilot Multi-Door Courthouse (MDC); and (2) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to designate the U.S. Claims Court to be a pilot MDC.  Terminates such designation and the program after three years. <p>Requires every court which has been designated as an MDC, to establish an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) plan providing for: (1) procedures for limited discovery; (2) confidentiality of proceedings as to possible subsequent pretrial and trial actions; (3) the selection, use, and payment of nonjudicial personnel who may be selected to conduct ADR proceedings as neutrals, mediators, or arbitrators; and (4) standards for determining which cases are appropriate for ADR, considering such factors as whether factual issues predominate over legal issues and whether the case involves complex or novel legal issues requiring judicial action. <p>Requires that each plan:  (1) provide that each assigned judge or magistrate judge conduct a conference with counsel within 120 days after the complaint is filed to review nonbinding, voluntary ADR procedures that may be used in lieu of litigation to resolve the claims in controversy; and (2) authorize the parties, if they agree, to use nonbinding ADR procedures (such as early evaluation by a neutral party, (mediation, minitrials, summary jury trial, and arbitration) in lieu of litigation to resolve the claims in controversy. <p>Authorizes the district courts to:  (1) use the volunteer services of nonjudicial personnel to conduct ADR proceedings as neutrals, mediators, and arbitrators; and (2) establish their compensation, subject to limits established by the Judicial Conference of the United States. <p>Authorizes the Chief Justice of the United States to designate and assign temporarily a district judge of one circuit for service in another circuit, either in a district court or court of appeals, whenever the business of that court so requires (under current law, upon presentation of a certificate of necessity by the chief judge or circuit justice of the circuit wherein the need arises). <p>Makes it the duty of the Director of the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts to secure information and report annually to the Chief Justice, the chief judges of the circuits, the Congress, and the Attorney General on the courts' need for temporary judicial resources to ease overcrowded dockets (including information on delays being encountered in the maintenance of civil suits). <p>Provides that:  (1) a State judicial officer shall not be held liable for any costs, including attorney fees, in any proceeding in vindication of civil rights brought against such officer for an act or omission of such officer while acting in an official capacity (act); and (2) in any civil action for deprivation of rights brought against a judicial officer for such an act, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree in the action was violated by such officer or declaratory relief was unavailable. <p>Amends the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act to provide that, in actions brought by any adult convicted of a crime and confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility, the court shall continue such case for a period not to exceed 180 days in order to require exhaustion of remedies.  (Current law calls for a 90-day extension if the court believes it would be approprate and in the interests of justice.) <p>Requires the Attorney General, upon request of a State or local corrections agency, to provide such agency with technical advice and assistance in establishing plain, speedy, and effective administrative remedies for inmate grievances. <p>Amends the Federal judicial code to authorize the court, with regard to proceedings in forma pauperis, to dismiss the case if satisfied that the action fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <p>Directs the Board of the Federal Judicial Center to study and include in the annual report of the activities of the Center determinations regarding ways in which case and docket management (including ADR) techniques may be applied to improve the cost-effectiveness of litigation and to eliminate unjustified expense and delay. <p>Provides that a court in banc shall consist of all circuit judges in regular service, with exceptions. <p>Repeals a provision authorizing any court of appeals having more than 15 active judges to perform its en banc function by such number of members of its en banc courts as may be prescribed by rule of the court of appeals.",,,,,,

and (2) the Secretary, in the interim, to provide water from the Keswick Dam sufficient to dilute the Spring Creek Debris Dam discharges to concentration levels that allow survival of fish life below Keswick Dam, except when the U.S. Corps of Engineers flood control criteria for Shasta Dam limits that capability. <p>Authorizes the Secretary to construct, in partnership with the State of California, a barrier at the head of Old River in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta by December 31, 1995, to partially mitigate the impact of the CVP and State Water project pumping plants in the south Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta on the survival of young outmigrating salmon that are diverted from the San Joaquin River to the pumps. <p>Directs the Task Force to:  (1) identify additional actions that would provide mitigation of CVP impacts on, protect, restore, and enhance, Central Valley fish and wildlife habitat; (2) develop the information needed to evaluate such actions technically, determine the economic and biological feasibility using specified criteria, determine appropriate cost allocations specific to each action, and select actions to recommend to the Congress for authorization to implement; and (3) report to the Congress according to a specified schedule until the year 2010 when the Task Force shall cease to exist. <p>Sets forth fish and wildlife habitat issues to be evaluated by the Task Force, including:  (1) determination of the flows and habitat restoration measures needed to protect, restore, and enhance salmon and steelhead trout in parts of the San Joaquin River; (2) investigation of actions allowing closure or screening of the Delta Cross Channel and Georgiana Slough to prevent the diversion of out-migrating salmon and steelhead trout through those facilities; (3) investigation of the need to expand or develop wildlife refuges in the Central Valley; (4) investigation of alternative means of improving the reliability of water supplies currently available to privately-owned wetlands in the Central Valley; (5) as a means of increasing survival of migrating young fish, investigation of the feasibility of using short pulses of increased water flows to move salmon, steelhead trout, and striped bass into and through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; (6) investigation of ways to maintain suitable temperatures for young salmon survival in the lower Sacramento River and in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta by controlling or relocating the discharge of irrigation return flows and sewage effluent; (7) investigation of the need for additional hatchery production to mitigate the impacts of water development on Central Valley fisheries where no other feasible means of mitigation is available or where hatchery production would enhance efforts to increase natural production of a particular species; (8) investigation of measures available to correct flow pattern problems in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta created by the operation of the CVP and the California State Water Project; (9) evaluation of measures to avoid unqualified losses of juvenile anadromous fish due to unscreened or inadequately screened diversions on the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, their tributaries, and in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; and (10) elimination of barriers to upstream migration of salmon and steelhead trout adults to spawning areas downstream of existing storage facilities in the Central Valley caused by agricultural diversions and other obstructions. <p>Directs the Secretary, the Committee, and the Task Force to consider specified criteria and factors and issue findings thereon when determining which alternate programs, policies, or procedures should be implemented to protect, restore, or enhance fish and wildlife conditions. <p>Sets forth provisions with respect to:  (1) cost allocations;

Applies such procedures to Federal habeas corpus cases brought by prisoners in State custody who are subject to a capital sentence.  Makes the applicability of such procedures contingent upon a State establishing a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners whose capital convictions and sentences have been upheld on direct appeal to the court of last resort in the State or have otherwise become final for State law purposes. States that the rule of court on statutes establishing such mechanism must provide standards of competency for the appointment of such counsel. <p>Directs that any such mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under capital sentence and must provide for the entry of an order by a court of record:  (1) appointing counsel to represent the prisoner upon a specified finding; (2) finding that the prisoner has rejected the offer of counsel and made the decision with an understanding of its legal consequences; or (3) denying the appointment of counsel upon a finding that the prisoner is not indigent. <p>Provides for a mandatory stay of execution during the post-conviction review initiated pursuant to this title.  Details conditions which will cause such stay to expire.  Prohibits a Federal court, if one of such conditions has occurred, from entering a stay of execution or granting relief in a capital case unless:  (1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not previously presented in the State or Federal courts; (2) the failure to raise the claim was the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, was the result of a recognition by the Supreme Court of a new Federal right that is retroactively applicable, or is due to the fact that the claim is based on facts that could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review; and (3) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt on the offense for which the death penalty was imposed. <p>Imposes time limits on filing for habeas corpus relief.  Requires such time limits to be tolled under",,,,,,

Specifies that the adjudication of petitions or motions involving habeas corpus in capital cases shall be granted priority by the district court and court of appeals over all noncapital matters. <p>Amends the CSA to require:  (1) the court, prior to sentencing on a conviction in a Federal court of a felony under such Act, to compile a list of assets owned by the defendant not subject to forfeiture; and (2) upon request of the Attorney General, the court to direct the defendant to provide proof that any asset owned by the defendant not on such list was legally obtained.  Authorizes the Attorney General to seize assets that the defendant does not prove were legally obtained.  Requires the proceeds from such assets to be deposited in the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund and to be available for transfer to the building and facilities account of the Federal prison system. <p>Sets forth provisions regarding the term of appointment, authority, and jurisdiction of special masters. <p>Requires the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to publish annually a report on the sentencing patterns of Federal judges. <p>Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the Federal courts, until five years after the enactment of this Act, from:  (1) holding prison crowding unconstitutional under the eighth amendment except to the extent that an individual plaintiff inmate proves that the crowding causes the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment; and (2) placing an inmate ceiling on any Federal, State, or local detention facility as an equitable measure for conditions that violate the eighth amendment unless crowding itself is inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on individual prisoners.  Requires that each Federal court order seeking to remedy an eighth amendment violation be reopened at the behest of a defendant for recommended alteration at a minimum of two-year intervals.  Applies this title to all outstanding court orders on the date of enactment of this Act.  Permits any State or municipality to seek modification of any outstanding eighth amendment decree pursuant to this Act. <p>Directs the Attorney General to take steps, consistent with security considerations, to ensure that sufficient facilities exist to house individuals whom the courts have ordered incarcerated.  Requires: (1) the Secretary of Defense, the Commission on Alternative Utilization of Military Facilities, and the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to identify suitable military installations and examine the feasibility of using temporary facilities for housing prisoners; and (2) the Director to report to the Congress within 90 days. <p>Amends the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act to require the Secretary to notify the Attorney General and the Governor of each of the U.S. territories and possessions (currently, all departments and instrumentalities within the Department of Defense (DOD)) of the availability of any real property or facility located at a military installation to be closed.

Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to impose the death penalty upon a finding of at least one aggravating and no mitigating factor, or one or more aggravating factors which outweigh any mitigating factors. <p> States that no person who was under 18 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. <p> Requires the court to instruct the jury not to consider the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of the defendant or victim in its consideration of the sentence. <p>Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence.  Requires the court of appeals, upon consideration of the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if:  (1) the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors; and (3) the proceedings did not involve any other prejudicial error requiring reversal of the sentence that was properly preserved for and raised on appeal.  Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. <p>Sets forth procedures for the implementation of the sentence of death. <p>Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death. <p>Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for:  (1) murder committed by prisoners in Federal prisons; (2) kidnapping which result in the death of any person; (3) hostage takings which result in the death of any person; (4) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (5) ""murder for hire""; (6) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (7) international terrorism (where the killing is a first-degree murder); (8) engaging in a criminal enterprise activity which results in death; (9) specified violations of the Controlled Substances Act, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, and the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act; and (10) genocide. <p>Increases the minimum sentence to life imprisonment for the crime of bank robbery which results in death. <p>Provides for appointment of counsel in Federal cases where a defendant is charged with a crime with respect to which a sentence of death is sought and is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation. Sets forth additional provisions with respect to:  (1) representation before and after review of judgement; (2) standards for competence of counsel; and (3) claims of ineffectiveness of counsel. <p>Sets forth provisions with respect to:  (1) deadlines for collateral attacks on judgements imposing a sentence of death; and (2) stays of execution. <p><b>Title II:  Habeas Corpus Reform - Subtitle A:  General Habeas Corpus Reform</b> - Habeas Corpus Reform Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal judicial code to establish a one-year statute of limitations for habeas corpus actions brought by State prisoners. <p>Vests authority to issue certificates for probable cause for appeal of habeas corpus orders exclusively in the courts of appeals. <p>Permits denial on the merits of a habeas corpus writ notwithstanding the failure to exhaust State remedies. <p>Prohibits the granting of a writ of habeas corpus with respect to any claim which has been fully and fairly adjudicated in State proceedings. <p>Sets forth provisions with respect to the appointment of counsel. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Death Penalty Litigation Procedures</b> - Death Penalty Litigation Procedures Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal judicial code to set forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases.  Applies such procedures to Federal habeas corpus cases brought by prisoners in State custody who are subject to a capital sentence.  Makes the applicability of such procedures contingent upon a State establishing a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners whose capital convictions and sentences have been upheld on direct appeal to the court of last resort in the State or have otherwise become final for State law purposes.  States that the rule of court on statutes establishing such mechanism must provide standards of competency for the appointment of such counsel. <p>Directs that any such mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under capital sentence and must provide for the entry of an order by a court of record:  (1) appointing counsel to represent the prisoner upon a specified finding; (2) finding that the prisoner has rejected the offer of counsel and made the decision with an understanding of its legal consequences; or (3) denying the appointment of counsel upon a finding that the prisoner is not indigent. <p>Provides for a mandatory stay of execution during the post-conviction review initiated pursuant to this Act.  Details conditions which will cause such stay to expire.  Prohibits a Federal court, if one of such conditions has occurred, from entering a stay of execution or granting relief in a capital case unless:  (1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not previously presented in the State or Federal courts; (2) the failure to raise the claim was the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, was the result of a recognition by the Supreme Court of a new Federal right that is retroactively applicable, or is due to the fact that the claim is based on facts that could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review; and (3) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt on the offense for which the death penalty was imposed. <p>Imposes time limits on filing for habeas corpus relief.  Requires such time limits to be tolled under specified conditions. <p>Requires the district court, upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, to rule on the merits of the claims properly before it. <p>Makes the requirement for a certificate of probable cause inapplicable, with exceptions, where:  (1) a second or successive petition is filed; and (2) certain requirements under a unitary review procedure (i.e., a State procedure that authorizes a person under sentence of death to raise, in the course of direct review of judgment, such claims as could be raised on collateral attack) are met. <p>Sets forth time limits for determining petitions.  Specifies that the adjudication of petitions or motions involving habeas corpus in capital cases shall be granted priority by the district court and court of appeals over all noncapital matters. <p><b>Title III: Exclusionary Rule</b> - Amends the Federal criminal code to bar the exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure carried out under circumstances justifying an objectively reasonable belief that it was in conformity with the fourth amendment. <p>Specifies that:  (1) Federal law does not require the exclusion of evidence in a proceeding in any court under circumstances in which the evidence would be admissible in a proceeding in a Federal court pursuant to this title; and (2) firearms seized by Federal law enforcement officers for use as evidence against a defendant who is being prosecuted for a crime of violence or serious drug offense, or who is ineligible to possess such firearm under the Federal criminal code, shall not be excluded in U.S.  court proceedings on the ground that the search or seizure was in violation of the fourth amendment. <p>Directs the Attorney General to promulgate rules and regulations relating to compliance by law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice with the fourth amendment, including:  (1) the training of such officers in the law of search and seizure; (2) procedures and standards of conduct to be observed in carrying out searches and seizures; (3) procedures for reporting and investigating incidents involving possible violations of legal or administrative requirements relating to searches and seizures; (4) sanctions to be imposed when such violations are determined to have occurred; and (5) standards and procedures for settling claims for damages by victims of unlawful searches and seizures. <p>Authorizes the head of any other Federal department or agency to promulgate rules and regulations relating to compliance with the fourth amendment by law enforcement officers of such department or agency. <p>Directs the Attorney General, and any other Federal department or agency head that promulgates such rules or regulations, to:  (1) establish a review board to consider all allegations of fourth amendment violations by law enforcement officers of such department or agency and to recommend or impose appropriate sanctions in cases where violations are determined to have occurred; and (2) report annually to the Congress concerning allegations and claims relating to search and seizure violations by law enforcement officers of such department or agency, the actions taken on such allegations and claims, and the bases for such actions.  Authorizes charging such a review board with recommending the settlement of claims for damages by victims of unlawful searches and seizures. <p>Specifies that evidence shall not be excluded on the ground that it was obtained in violation of a statute, an administrative rule or regulation, or a rule of procedure unless exclusion is expressly authorized by statute or by a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. <p><b>Title IV:  Firearms - Subtitle A:  Firearms and Related Amendments</b> - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the transfer of firearms to non-residents of the State in which the transferor resides. <p>Specifies that if a conviction was for a violent felony involving the threatened or actual use of a firearm or explosives, or was for a serious drug offense, such person shall be considered convicted for purposes of this Act irrespective of any pardon, setting aside, expunction, or restoration of civil rights. <p>Permits the judicial officer to consider pretrial detention with respect to certain firearms and explosives offenses. <p>Provides for enhanced penalties for:  (1) the use of a semiautomatic firearm during a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, with exceptions; and (2) possession of a firearm or explosive during the commission of such offenses. <p>Sets forth penalties for smuggling firearms in aid of drug trafficking and for theft of firearms and explosives. <p>Provides for the mandatory revocation of the supervised release of an individual for possession of a firearm. <p>Increases penalties for:  (1) making knowingly false, material statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm from a licensed dealer; and (2) a second offense of using an explosive to commit a Federal felony. <p>Amends the Internal Revenue Code to:  (1) change from six to five years the statute of limitations for certain firearms offenses; and (2) provide for the summary forfeiture of unregistered National Firearms Act weapons, with provision for reimbursement for innocent owners. <p>Makes it unlawful for felons and others to possess explosives. <p>Authorizes the summary destruction of explosives subject to forfeiture under specified circumstances.  Sets forth requirements for reimbursement of the value of destroyed property. <p>Makes it unlawful to knowingly possess stolen firearms, ammunition, or explosives. <p>Adds using a firearm in the commission of counterfeiting or forgery (current law specifies only ""whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime"") among offenses which, if the offender uses or carries a firearm, will subject such person to an enhanced sentence. <p>Provides for a mandatory five year penalty for firearms possession by violent felons and serious drug offenders. <p>Modifies provisions regarding the reporting of multiple firearms sales to:  (1) cover sales during any 30 consecutive days (currently, during any five consecutive business days); and (2) require each licensee to forward a copy of the report to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the unlicensed person not later than the close of business on the date that the multiple sale or disposition occurs. <p>Subjects individuals who conspire to commit a firearms or explosives offense to the same penalties as those prescribed for the underlying offense. <p>Provides for a fine or up to ten years imprisonment, or both, for stealing a firearm or explosive from specified individuals, such as a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer. <p>Makes it unlawful for any person (current law specifies licensee) to distribute explosive materials to specified classes of individuals. <p><b>Title V:  Obstruction of Justice</b> - Increases penalties for obstruction of justice offenses against court officers and jurors and for retaliatory killings of witnesses, victims, and informants. <p> Includes State and local law enforcement officers assisting Federal officers or employees in the performance of their official duties within the scope of provisions setting penalties for individuals who kill or attempt to kill any U.S. judge, U.S. Attorney, or specified other classes of individuals. <p><b>Title VI:  Gangs and Juvenile Offenders</b> - Requires that juveniles found guilty of specified serious crimes be fingerprinted and photographed and that such information and records of the adjudication be sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. <p>Authorizes reporting, retention, disclosure, and availability of juvenile records permitted under the law of the State in which a Federal juvenile proceeding takes place. <p>Repeals provisions that authorize prejudgement probation for certain drug offenders convicted of possession of a controlled substance and requires expungement of records for such offenders under 21 years of age at the time of the offense.

Deems a seller not liable except for breach of warranty where there was no opportunity to inspect the product in a manner which would or should, in the exercise of reasonable care, have revealed the aspect which allegedly caused the harm. <p>Declares that the seller shall be treated as the manufacturer and be liable for harm caused by a product as if it were the manufacturer if:  (1) the manufacturer is not subject to service of process in any State in which the action might have been brought; or (2) the court determines that the claimant would be unable to enforce a judgment against the manufacturer. <p>Allows punitive damages, if otherwise permitted by applicable law, to be awarded in any civil action under this title to any claimant who establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the harm suffered was the result of conduct manifesting a manufacturer's or product seller's conscious, flagrant indifference to the safety of those persons who might be harmed by a product.  Declares that a failure to exercise reasonable care in choosing among alternative product designs, formulations, instructions, or warnings is not of itself such conduct. Prohibits awarding punitive damages in the absence of a compensatory award, subject to exception. <p>Prohibits punitive damages against a manufacturer or seller of a drug or medical device where:  (1) the drug or device was subject to pre-market approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); or (2) the drug is generally recognized as safe and effective under conditions established by the FDA. <p>Prohibits punitive damages against a manufacturer of an aircraft where:  (1) the aircraft was subject to pre-market certification by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); and (2) the manufacturer complied, after delivery, with FAA requirements and obligations with respect to continuing airworthiness. <p>Provides for separate proceedings, if requested by the manufacturer or seller, with regard to punitive damages. <p>Lists factors the trier of fact is allowed to consider in determining the amount of punitive damages. <p>Bars any civil action under this title:  (1) unless filed within two years after the claimant discovered or should have discovered the harm and its cause, subject to exception; and (2) if the product involved is a capital good that is alleged to have caused harm which is not a toxic harm unless filed within twenty-five years after delivery of the product, provided the claimant has received or would be eligible for State or Federal workers' compensation.  Excludes a motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or railroad used primarily to transport passengers for hire from these time limitations.  States that nothing in these provisions affects the right of any person who is subject to liability under this Act to obtain contribution or indemnity from any other person who is responsible for the harm. <p>Requires reduction in the damages awarded by the sum of all State or Federal workers' compensation benefits to which the employee is or would be entitled.  Requires a claimant in a civil action under this title who is or may be eligible to receive State or Federal workers' compensation to notify the claimant's employer of the civil action.  Requires an action to be stayed, at the sole discretion of the claimant, until a final determination is made on the amount payable as workers' compensation benefits.  Declares that, unless the manufacturer or seller has expressly agreed to indemnify or hold an employer harmless, neither the employer nor the workers' compensation insurance carrier shall have a right of subrogation, contribution, or implied indemnity against the manufacturer or seller or a lien against the claimant's recovery, except if the claimant's harm was not in any way caused by the fault of the claimant's employer or co-employees.  Allows the employer or workers' compensation insurer to intervene in the action to prove that fact. <p>Prohibits a third party tortfeasor, where workers' compensation is involved, from maintaining any action for implied indemnity or contribution against the employer, any coemployee, or the exclusive representative of the injured person.  Prohibits, for a person who is or would have been entitled to receive workers' compensation, any other action, unless a State or Federal workers' compensation law permits recovery based on a claim of an intentional tort.  Makes these provisions inapplicable and declares that applicable State law shall control if the employer or the workers' compensation insurer asserts a right of subrogation, contribution, or implied indemnity against the manufacturer or seller or a lien against the claimant's recovery. <p>Declares that, in any product liability action, the liability of each defendant for noneconomic damages shall be several and not joint. Requires the trier of fact to determine the proportion of responsibility of each party for the claimant's harm. <p>Establishes a complete defense, in any civil action under this Act in which all defendants are manufacturers or sellers, that the claimant was under the influence of alcohol or any drug and that, as a result, the claimant was more than 50 percent responsible for the event which resulted in the harm.  Defines ""drug"" to mean any non-over-the-counter drug which has not been prescribed by a physician.",,,,,,

Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to impose the death penalty upon a finding of at least one aggravating and no mitigating factor, or one or more aggravating factors which outweigh any mitigating factors. <p> States that no person who was under 18 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. <p> Requires the court to instruct the jury not to consider the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of the defendant or victim in its consideration of the sentence. <p>Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence.  Requires the court of appeals, upon consideration of the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if:  (1) the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors; and (3) the proceedings did not involve any other prejudicial error requiring reversal of the sentence that was properly preserved for and raised on appeal.  Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. <p>Sets forth procedures for the implementation of the sentence of death. <p>Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death. <p>Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for:  (1) murder committed by prisoners in Federal prisons; (2) kidnappings which result in the death of any person; (3) hostage takings which result in the death of any person; (4) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (5) murder for hire; (6) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (7) international terrorism (where the killing is a first-degree murder); (8) engaging in a criminal enterprise activity which results in death; (9) specified violations of the Controlled Substances Act, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, and the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act; and (10) genocide. <p>Increases the minimum sentence to life imprisonment for the crime of bank robbery which results in death. <p>Provides for appointment of counsel in Federal cases where a defendant is charged with a crime with respect to which a sentence of death is sought and is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation. Sets forth additional provisions with respect to:  (1) representation before and after review of judgement; (2) standards for competence of counsel; and (3) claims of ineffectiveness of counsel. <p>Sets forth provisions with respect to:  (1) deadlines for collateral attacks on judgements imposing a sentence of death; and (2) stays of execution. <p><b>Title II:  Habeas Corpus Reform - Subtitle A:  General Habeas Corpus Reform</b> - Habeas Corpus Reform Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal judicial code to establish a one-year statute of limitations for habeas corpus actions brought by State prisoners. <p>Vests authority to issue certificates for probable cause for appeal of habeas corpus orders exclusively in the courts of appeals. <p>Permits denial on the merits of habeas corpus writs notwithstanding the failure to exhaust State remedies. <p>Prohibits the granting of a habeas corpus with respect to any claim which has been fully and fairly adjudicated in State proceedings. <p>Sets forth provisions with respect to the appointment of counsel. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Death Penalty Litigation Procedures</b> - Death Penalty Litigation Procedures Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal judicial code to set forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases.  Applies such procedures to Federal habeas corpus cases brought by prisoners in State custody who are subject to a capital sentence.  Makes the applicability of such procedures contingent upon a State establishing a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners whose capital convictions and sentences have been upheld on direct appeal to the court of last resort in the State or have otherwise become final for State law purposes.  States that the rule of court on statutes establishing such mechanism must provide standards of competency for the appointment of such counsel. <p>Directs that any such mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under capital sentence and must provide for the entry of an order by a court of record:  (1) appointing counsel to represent the prisoner upon a specified finding; (2) finding that the prisoner has rejected the offer of counsel and made the decision with an understanding of its legal consequences; or (3) denying the appointment of counsel upon a finding that the prisoner is not indigent. <p>Provides for a mandatory stay of execution during the post-conviction review initiated pursuant to this Act.  Details conditions which will cause such stay to expire.  Prohibits a Federal court, if one of such conditions has occurred, from entering a stay of execution or granting relief in a capital case unless:  (1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not previously presented in the State or Federal courts; (2) the failure to raise the claim was the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, was the result of a recognition by the Supreme Court of a new Federal right that is retroactively applicable, or is due to the fact that the claim is based on facts that could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review; and (3) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt on the offense for which the death penalty was imposed. <p>Imposes time limits on filing for habeas corpus relief.  Requires such time limits to be tolled under specified conditions. <p>Requires the district court, upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, to rule on the merits of the claims properly before it. <p>Makes the requirement for a certificate of probable cause inapplicable, with exceptions, where:  (1) a second or successive petition is filed; and (2) certain requirements under a unitary review procedure (i.e., a State procedure that authorizes a person under sentence of death to raise, in the course of direct review of judgment, such claims as could be raised on collateral attack) are met. <p>Sets forth time limits for determining petitions.  Specifies that the adjudication of petitions or motions involving habeas corpus in capital cases shall be granted priority by the district court and court of appeals over all noncapital matters. <p><b>Title III: Exclusionary Rule</b> - Amends the Federal criminal code to bar the exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure carried out under circumstances justifying an objectively reasonable belief that it was in conformity with the fourth amendment. <p>Specifies that:  (1) Federal law does not require the exclusion of evidence in a proceeding in any court under circumstances in which the evidence would be admissible in a proceeding in a Federal court pursuant to this title; and (2) firearms seized by Federal law enforcement officers for use as evidence against a defendant who is being prosecuted for a crime of violence or serious drug offense, or who is ineligible to possess such firearm under the Federal criminal code, shall not be excluded in U.S.  court proceedings on the ground that the search or seizure was in violation of the fourth amendment. <p>Directs the Attorney General to promulgate rules and regulations relating to compliance by law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice with the fourth amendment, including:  (1) the training of such officers in the law of search and seizure; (2) procedures and standards of conduct to be observed in carrying out searches and seizures; (3) procedures for reporting and investigating incidents involving possible violations of legal or administrative requirements relating to searches and seizures; (4) sanctions to be imposed when such violations are determined to have occurred; and (5) standards and procedures for settling claims for damages by victims of unlawful searches and seizures. <p>Authorizes the head of any other Federal department or agency to promulgate rules and regulations relating to compliance with the fourth amendment by law enforcement officers of such department or agency. <p>Directs the Attorney General, and any other Federal department or agency head that promulgates such rules or regulations, to:  (1) establish a review board to consider all allegations of fourth amendment violations by law enforcement officers of such department or agency and to recommend or impose appropriate sanctions in cases where violations are determined to have occurred; and (2) report annually to the Congress concerning allegations and claims relating to search and seizure violations by law enforcement officers of such department or agency, the actions taken on such allegations and claims, and the bases for such actions.  Authorizes charging such a review board with recommending the settlement of claims for damages by victims of unlawful searches and seizures. <p>Specifies that evidence shall not be excluded on the ground that it was obtained in violation of a statute, an administrative rule or regulation, or a rule of procedure unless exclusion is expressly authorized by statute or by a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. <p><b>Title IV:  Firearms - Subtitle A:  Firearms and Related Amendments</b> - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the transfer of firearms to non-residents of the State in which the transferor resides. <p>Specifies that if a conviction was for a violent felony involving the threatened or actual use of a firearm or explosives, or was for a serious drug offense, such person shall be considered convicted for purposes of this Act irrespective of any pardon, setting aside, expunction, or restoration of civil rights. <p>Permits the judicial officer to consider pretrial detention with respect to certain firearms and explosives offenses. <p>Provides for enhanced penalties for:  (1) the use of a semiautomatic firearm during a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, with exceptions; and (2) possession of a firearm or explosive during the commission of such offenses. <p>Sets forth penalties for smuggling firearms in aid of drug trafficking and for theft of firearms and explosives. <p>Provides for the mandatory revocation of the supervised release of an individual for possession of a firearm. <p>Increases penalties for:  (1) making knowingly false, material statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm from a licensed dealer; and (2) a second offense of using an explosive to commit a Federal felony. <p>Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to:  (1) change from six to five years the statute of limitations for certain firearms offenses; and (2) provide for the summary forfeiture of unregistered National Firearms Act weapons, with provision for reimbursement for innocent owners. <p>Makes it unlawful for felons and others to possess explosives. <p>Authorizes the summary destruction of explosives subject to forfeiture under specified circumstances.  Sets forth requirements for reimbursement of the value of destroyed property. <p>Makes it unlawful to knowingly possess stolen firearms, ammunition, or explosives. <p>Adds using a firearm in the commission of counterfeiting or forgery (current law specifies only ""whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime"") among offenses which, if the offender uses or carries a firearm, will subject such person to an enhanced sentence. <p>Provides for a mandatory five year penalty for firearms possession by violent felons and serious drug offenders. <p>Modifies provisions regarding the reporting of multiple firearms sales to:  (1) cover sales during any 30 consecutive days (currently, during any five consecutive business days); and (2) require each licensee to forward a copy of the report to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the unlicensed person not later than the close of business on the date that the multiple sale or disposition occurs. <p>Subjects individuals who conspire to commit a firearms or explosives offense to the same penalties as those prescribed for the underlying offense. <p>Provides for a fine or up to ten years imprisonment, or both, for stealing a firearm or explosive from specified individuals, such as a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer. <p>Makes it unlawful for any person (current law specifies licensee) to distribute explosive materials to specified classes of individuals. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Prohibited Gun Clips and Magazines</b> - Includes ammunition feeding devices (AFDs) within the definition of firearms for purposes of Federal firearms laws.  Defines an AFD to include any detachable magazine, feed strip, or similar device which has a capacity of, or which can be readily converted to accept, more than 15 rounds of ammunition, with exceptions. <p>Prohibits the importation, manufacture, transfer, receipt, or possession of AFDs, with exceptions.  Requires the Secretary of the Treasury  to maintain a central registry of all such devices transferred after the effective date of this Act which, after such transfer, are not under the control of the United States or any State or political subdivision.  Specifies that such registry shall include:  (1) identification of the device; (2) date of registration; (3) identification and address of the person entitled to possess the device; and (4) such other information as may be required by regulations promulgated by the Secretary.  Establishes additional registration procedures. <p>Requires all AFDs to be identified by a serial number and such other identification as the Secretary may prescribe. <p>Provides for criminal penalties for violation of provisions of this Act relative to AFDs. <p>Authorizes specified individuals engaged in the manufacture or importation of AFDs requiring a license to continue to engage in such business pending final action on the application. <p><b>Title V:  Obstruction of Justice</b> - Increases penalties for obstruction of justice offenses against court officers and jurors and for retaliatory killings of witnesses, victims, and informants. <p> Includes State and local law enforcement officers assisting Federal officers or employees in the performance of their official duties within the scope of provisions setting penalties for individuals who kill or attempt to kill any U.S. judge, U.S. Attorney, or specified other classes of individuals. <p><b>Title VI:  Gangs and Juvenile Offenders</b> - Requires that juveniles found guilty of specified serious crimes be fingerprinted and photographed and that such information and records of the adjudication be sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. <p>Authorizes reporting, retention, disclosure, and availability of juvenile records permitted under the law of the State in which a Federal juvenile proceeding takes place. <p>Repeals provisions that authorize prejudgement probation for certain drug offenders convicted of possession of a controlled substance and require expungement of records for such offenders under 21 years of age at the time of the offense. <p>Adds certain cocaine and drug conspiracy and attempt offenses committed by juveniles to the list of crimes authorizing prosecution as an adult if the Attorney General certifies that there is a substantial Federal interest in the case that justifies adult prosecution.

Requires that the employee receive a written explanation of rights and remedies under this Act before signing such a waiver.  Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to prepare and publish a model explanation.

Provides that, if an exchange is made with land bought by the Bureau of Reclamation for the construction and operation of the CAP, then, upon commencement of repayment by CAWCD of the reimbursable costs of the CAP, the fair market value of the lands exchanged shall be credited in full against the annual payments due from CAWCD under the terms of its repayment contract with the United States. <p>Amends the Colorado River Basin Project Act to repeal the requirement that the Secretary find that a surplus of groundwater exists and that drainage is or was required as a precondition for permitting groundwater to be pumped from within the exterior boundaries of a CAP contractor's service area for any use outside such area. <p>Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed:  (1) to affect the water rights or the water rights claims of any Federal agency other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs on behalf of the Tribe; or (2) to prohibit the United States from confirming in the Agreement executed pursuant to this Act, except on behalf of Indian tribes other than the San Carlos Apache Tribe, the Gila River and Little Colorado River watershed water rights of other parties to the Agreement by making express provisions for the same in such Agreement.",,,,,,

States that the rule of court on statutes establishing such mechanism must provide standards of competency for the appointment of such counsel. <p>Directs that any such mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under capital sentence and must provide for the entry of an order by a court of record:  (1) appointing counsel to represent the prisoner upon a specified finding; (2) finding that the prisoner has rejected the offer of counsel and made the decision with an understanding of its legal consequences; or (3) denying the appointment of counsel upon a finding that the prisoner is not indigent. <p>Provides for a mandatory stay of execution during the post-conviction review initiated pursuant to this Act.  Details conditions which will cause such stay to expire.  Prohibits a Federal court, if one of such conditions has occurred, from entering a stay of execution or granting relief in a capital case unless:   (1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not previously presented in the State or Federal courts; (2) the failure to raise the claim was the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, was the result of a recognition by the Supreme Court of a new Federal right that is retroactively applicable, or is due to the fact that the claim is based on facts that could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review; and (3) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt on the offense for which the death penalty was imposed. <p>Imposes time limits on filing for habeas corpus relief.  Requires such time limits to be tolled under specified conditions. <p>Requires the district court, upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, to rule on the merits of the claims properly before it. <p>Makes the requirement for a certificate of probable cause inapplicable, with an exception.",,,,,,

Authorizes a cable television (TV) franchising authority to regulate such rates, but only as provided under the Act. <p>Bars a Federal agency, State, or franchising authority from regulating the rates for cable service of a cable system that is owned or operated by a local government or franchising authority within whose jurisdiction that system is located and that is the only cable system located within such jurisdiction. <p>Specifies that if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) finds that a cable system is:  (1) subject to effective competition, the rates for the provision of cable service by such system shall not be subject to regulation by the FCC or by a State or franchising authority under the Act; and (2) not subject to effective competition, the rates for the provision of basic cable and cable programming services shall be subject to regulation by a franchising authority or the FCC, or solely by the FCC, respectively. <p>Requires a franchising authority that seeks to exercise regulatory jurisdiction to file with the FCC a written certification that:  (1) such authority will adopt and administer regulations with respect to the rates subject to regulation that are consistent with FCC-prescribed regulations, and has the legal authority to adopt and the personnel to administer such regulations; and (2) procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate regulatory proceedings by such authority provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties. <p>Sets forth provisions regarding:  (1) FCC approval of such certifications; (2) revocation of jurisdiction of such authority; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction by the FCC if it disapproves a franchising authority's certification or revokes such authority's jurisdiction. <p>Directs the FCC to ensure that the rates for the basic service tier are reasonable and to prescribe regulations to carry out such obligation.  Requires such regulations to include standards to: (1) establish the price or rate for equipment used by subscribers to receive the basic service tier; and (2) identify costs attributable to satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational, and governmental channels. <p>Provides that certain procedures prescribed by the FCC shall require cable operators to provide advance notice to a franchising authority of any increase proposed in the price for the basic service tier. <p>Requires each cable operator to offer its subscribers a separately available basic service tier to which the minimum rates shall apply and to which subscription is required for access to all other tiers of service.  Mandates that such basic service tier include:  (1) any public, educational, and governmental access programming required by the franchise of the cable system; and (2) any signal of any broadcast station that is provided by the cable operator to any subscriber, except a signal secondarily transmitted by a satellite carrier beyond the local service area.  Permits a cable operator to add additional video programming signals or services to the basic service tier. <p>Prohibits (with exceptions) a cable operator from:  (1) requiring the subscription to any tier other than the basic service tier as a condition of access to cable programming offered on a per channel or per program basis; or (2) discriminating between subscribers to the basic service tier and other subscribers with respect to rates charged for video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis. <p>Directs the FCC to establish:  (1) criteria for identifying rates for cable programming services that are unreasonable; (2) fair and expeditious procedures for the receipt, consideration, and resolution of complaints alleging that a rate for cable programming services violates the criteria established; and (3) the procedures to be used to reduce rates determined by the FCC to be unreasonable and to refund such portion of the rates or charges that were paid by subscribers after the filing of such complaint that are determined to be unreasonable.  Outlines factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of such rates and limits complaints permitted concerning rates existing before the effective date of such regulations. <p>Requires a cable operator to have a uniform rate structure throughout the geographic area in which cable service is provided. <p>Prohibits discrimination among customers of basic service, except that no Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may prohibit a cable operator from offering reasonable discounts to senior citizens or other economically disadvantaged group discounts.  Bars a cable operator from charging a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested. <p>Directs the FCC to:  (1) require cable operators to file certain financial information annually with the FCC; (2) establish standards, guidelines, and procedures to prevent evasions of requirements of the Act; (3) design its regulations to reduce the administrative burdens and cost of compliance for cable systems that have 1,000 or fewer subscribers; and (4) publish annual statistical reports on the average rates for basic service and other cable programming, and for converter boxes, remote control units, and other equipment of cable systems that the FCC has found are subject to effective competition compared with those that are found not subject to such effective competition. <p>Makes provisions of the Act (and regulations thereunder) inapplicable to a cable system during the term of an agreement by a cable operator with a franchising authority that was entered into before July 1, 1990, and that authorizes such authority to regulate the rates of such system for basic cable service, if there was not effective competition pursuant to FCC rules in effect on such date. <p>Requires cable operators to carry the signals of all local commercial TV stations (LCTS) and qualified low power stations in accordance with the following provisions:  (1) cable operators with 12 or fewer usable activated channels must carry a minimum of three LCTS, while those with more than 12 must carry the signals of LCTS up to one-third of the aggregate number of usable activated channels of the cable system; (2) whenever the number of LCTS exceeds the maximum number of signals a cable system is required to carry, such operator shall have discretion in selecting which such stations shall be carried on its system, with exceptions; (3) cable operators must carry in its entirety the primary video and audio transmission and line 21 closed-caption transmission of the LCTS carried; (4) signals of an LCTS must be carried by the cable operator without material degradation; (5) duplicate LCTS need not be carried by a participating cable operator; (6) each signal carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations of a cable operator shall be carried on the cable system channel number on which the LCTS is broadcast over the air, or on the channel on which it was carried on January 1, 1992, at the election of the station, or on such other channel number as is mutually agreed upon by the station and the cable operator (with disputes regarding LCTS positioning resolved by the FCC); (7) signals carried in fulfillment of the cable operator's requirements shall be provided to every subscriber of a cable system; (8) a cable operator shall identify upon request those signals carried in fulfillment of its requirements; and (9) a cable operator shall provide written notice to an LCTS that such channel is being repositioned or deleted.  Prohibits a cable operator from accepting or requesting monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange for carriage of LCTS under these provisions, except for certain administrative costs. <p>Provides that if there are not sufficient signals of full power LCTS to fill the channels set aside, a cable operator with a system capacity of 35 or fewer usable activated channels shall be required to carry one qualified low power station (two stations for operators exceeding such capacity). <p>Outlines remedies and procedures available to an LCTS when it believes that a cable system has failed to meet such requirements, requiring the cable operator to be notified of the allegation, to respond to such allegation, review by the FCC of such complaint, and remedial actions to be taken by the cable operator upon a finding of noncompliance with such requirements.  Abolishes rules requiring cable operators to provide, or provide information to subscribers on, input selector switches or comparable devices.  Directs the FCC to issue regulations regarding the carriage of local commercial TV signals. <p>Specifies that pending the FCC inquiry on sales presentations, nothing in the Act shall require a cable operator to carry on any tier, or prohibit a cable operator from carrying on any tier, the signal of any commercial TV station or video programming service that is predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials. <p>Directs the FCC to commence an inquiry to determine whether broadcast stations whose programming consists predominantly of sales presentations or program length commercials are serving the public interest.  Requires the FCC, if arriving upon a negative determination, to allow the licensees of such station a reasonable period to provide different programming, without a denial of renewal expectancy based solely upon such prior programming. <p>Authorizes the FCC:  (1) with respect to a particular TV broadcast station, to include additional communities within its TV market or exclude communities from such station's TV market to better effectuate the purpose of the Act; and (2) in considering such requests, to determine that particular communities are part of more than one TV market.  Directs the FCC to:  (1) afford particular attention to the value of localism by taking specified factors into account; and (2) provide for expedited consideration of such requests.  Bars a cable operator from deleting from carriage the signal of a commercial TV station during the pendency of any proceeding pursuant to such provisions. <p>Directs each cable operator to carry the signals of a specified number of qualified noncommercial educational TV stations (QNETS) (defined as a TV broadcast station which:  (1) under FCC rules and regulations in effect on March 29, 1990, is licensed by the FCC as a noncommercial educational TV broadcast station, which is owned and operated by a public agency, nonprofit foundation, corporation, or association; and (2) has as its licensee an entity which is eligible to receive a community service grant (or any successor grant) from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (or any successor organization) on the basis of a specified formula, or is owned and operated by a municipality, and transmits predominantly noncommercial programs for educational purposes), such number increasing with the number of usable activated channels offered by the cable system (ranging from one for a system with 12 or fewer activated channels to three for a system with more than 36 usable activated channels).  Requires a cable system with 13 to 36 activated channels to carry at least one QNETS.  Provides that duplication of affiliates of State public TV networks is not required of a cable operator. <p>Requires each cable operator to retransmit in its entirety the primary video and audio and line 21 closed-caption transmission of each QNETS carried on its system, as well as material necessary for the receipt of such programming by handicapped persons or for educational or language purposes.  Outlines other signal carriage requirements required of a cable operator with regard to QNETS, including:  (1) signal integrity; (2) channel assignments (requiring notice if a QNETS is repositioned by a cable operator); and (3) signal quality responsibilities of the QNETS.  Prohibits a cable operator from accepting monetary payments or other valuable consideration (except for signal quality costs) in exchange for the carriage of a QNETS.  Exempts a cable operator from being required to carry a QNETS without indemnification where the payment of increased copyright costs for a distant signal would be required of such cable operator. <p>Outlines remedies available to a qualified local noncommercial educational TV station when it believes that a cable operator has failed to meet carriage requirements, requiring the cable operator to be notified of the allegation, a response from the cable operator, and review of such complaint by the FCC.  Requires a cable operator to identify upon request those signals carried in fulfillment of its requirements. <p>Prohibits a cable system or multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD), beginning one year after enactment of this Act, from retransmitting any part of the signal of a broadcast station without the express authority of the originating station or except in the case of a station asserting the right to carriage. Provides exceptions to such prohibition for certain retransmitted signals.  Requires the FCC to establish regulations governing the exercise by TV broadcast stations of the right to grant retransmission consent and of the right to signal carriage. Requires the FCC in such regulations to consider the impact that the grant of retransmission consent may have on the rates for the basic service tier and to ensure that such rates are reasonable. Requires TV stations, under such regulations, to elect between the right to grant retransmission authority and the right to signal carriage.  Makes such election applicable to all cable systems within the same geographic area. <p>Prohibits a cable television franchising authority from granting an exclusive franchise or unreasonably refusing to award additional cable television franchises. <p>Requires a franchising authority, in awarding a franchise, to allow the applicant's cable system a reasonable opportunity to become capable of providing service to all households in the franchise area. <p>Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to:  (1) prohibit local authorities affiliated with a franchising authority from operating as MVPDs in the franchise area; or (2) require such authorities to secure a franchise to operate as a MVPD. <p>Authorizes a franchising authority to enforce (currently, to require as part of a franchise, or for franchise renewal, enforcement of):  (1) customer service requirements of the cable operator; and (2) construction schedules and other construction-related requirements. <p>Directs the FCC to establish standards by which cable operators may fulfill their customer service requirements, which shall govern:  (1) cable system office hours and telephone availability; (2) installations, outages, and service calls; and (3) communications between the cable operator and the subscriber (including bills and refunds). <p>Specifies that nothing in the Act shall be construed to:  (1) prohibit any State or franchising authority from enacting or enforcing any consumer protection law, to the extent not specifically preempted by the Act; (2) preclude a franchising authority and a cable operator from agreeing to customer service requirements that exceed FCC standards; or (3) prevent the establishment or enforcement of any municipal law or regulation, or any State law, concerning customer service that imposes customer service requirements that exceed FCC standards, or that addresses matters not addressed by FCC standards. <p>Authorizes the FCC to:  (1) determine the maximum reasonable rates a cable operator may establish for the commercial use of designated channel capacity; (2) establish reasonable terms and conditions for such use; and (3) establish procedures for the expedited resolution of disputes concerning rates or carriage. <p>Directs a cable operator required to designate channel capacity for commercial use to use any such channel capacity for programming from a qualified minority programming or educational programming source.  Limits to 33 percent of total capacity the channel capacity allowed for such programming.  Makes programming already provided over a cable system on July 1, 1990, ineligible to qualify as minority or educational programming under this provision. <p>Authorizes cable operators to enforce prospectively a written and published policy of prohibiting programming that the operator reasonably believes describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards.  Directs the FCC to promulgate regulations to limit the access of children to indecent programming as defined by FCC regulations and which cable operators have not voluntarily prohibited. <p>Directs the FCC to promulgate regulations to enable a cable operator to prohibit the use on its system of channel capacity of public, educational, or governmental access for programming which contains obscene material, sexually explicit conduct, or material soliciting or promoting unlawful conduct. <p>Makes it unlawful for a cable operator to hold a license for a multi-channel multipoint distribution service, or to offer satellite master antenna television service separate and apart from any franchised cable service, in any portion of the cable community served by that cable operator's cable system.  Directs the FCC to waive such prohibition in certain instances. <p>Provides that nothing in the Act shall be construed to prevent any State or franchising authority from prohibiting the ownership or control of a cable system in a jurisdiction by any person:  (1) because of such person's ownership or control of any other cable system in such jurisdiction; or (2) in circumstances in which the State or franchising authority determines that the acquisition of a cable system may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of service in such jurisdiction. <p>Directs the FCC to conduct a proceeding to:  (1) prescribe rules establishing reasonable limits on the number of cable subscribers a person is authorized to reach through cable systems in which the person has an attributable interest; (2) prescribe rules establishing reasonable limits on the number of channels on a cable system that can be occupied by a video programmer in which a cable operator has an attributable interest; and (3) consider the necessity of imposing limitations on the degree to which MVPDs may engage in the creation or production of video programming. <p>Requires the FCC to establish regulations governing program carriage agreements and related practices between cable operators or other MVPDs and video programming vendors (defined as persons engaged in the production, creation, or wholesale distribution of a video programming service for sale).  Specifies prohibitions to be included in such regulations relating to discrimination, conflicting financial interests, exclusivity, cost recovery, expedited review, and appropriate penalties. <p>Prohibits a cable operator from selling a cable system for three years after its acquisition.  Provides for the treatment of multiple transfers of systems.  Provides exceptions to such regulation and allows the FCC to waive such requirement in the public interest. Limits to 120 days a franchising authority's power to disapprove the sale of a cable system by an operator who has held such system for three years. <p>Authorizes each cable operator to identify, on a separate line on each bill sent to a subscriber, the amount of the total bill assessed: (1) for franchise fees; (2) to satisfy public, educational, or governmental channel carriage requirements; and (3) for fees, taxes, or other government charges imposed on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber. <p>Directs cable operators to notify subscribers of plans to offer a premium channel without charge and to block such channel upon a subscriber's request.  Defines ""premium channel"" as a pay service which offers movies rated X, NC-17, or R by the Motion Picture Association. <p>Requires each cable operator to comply with such standards as the FCC shall prescribe to ensure that viewers of video programming on cable systems are afforded the same emergency information as is afforded by the emergency broadcasting system. <p>Directs the FCC to establish minimum technical standards relating to the cable systems' technical operation and signal quality, and periodically update such standards to reflect improvements in technology.  Permits a franchising authority to require as part of a franchise provisions for the enforcement of such standards and to apply to the FCC for a waiver to impose standards that are more stringent than the FCC standards.  (Current law permits the FCC to establish technical standards relating to the facilities and equipment of cable systems which a franchising authority may require in the franchise.) <p>Authorizes a franchising authority to require a cable operator to: (1) provide 30 days' advance written notice of any change in channel assignment or in the video programming service provided over any such channel; and (2) inform subscribers, via written notice, that comments on programming and channel position changes are being recorded by a designated office of the franchising authority. <p>Directs the FCC to prescribe rules and regulations concerning the disposition, after a cable subscriber terminates service, of any cable installed by the operator within the premises of such subscriber. <p>Directs the FCC to:  (1) report to the Congress on means of assuring compatibility between TVs and video cassette recorders (VCRs) and cable systems, consistent with the need to prevent theft of cable service, so that cable subscribers will be able to enjoy the full benefit of both the programming available on cable systems and the functions available on their TVs and VCRs; and (2) issue such regulations as necessary to assure such compatibility. <p>Requires the FCC to determine under what circumstances to permit cable systems to scramble or encrypt signals or to restrict systems in the manner in which they encrypt or scramble signals. <p>Sets forth factors for the FCC to consider, including:  (1) the costs and benefits of imposing compatibility requirements on cable operators and TV manufacturers in a manner that will minimize interference with or nullification of the special functions of subscribers' TV receivers or VCRs while providing effective protection against theft or unauthorized reception of cable service; and (2) the need for cable operators to protect the integrity of the signals transmitted by the cable operator against theft or to protect such signals against unauthorized reception. <p>States that any lawful action to revoke a cable operator's franchise for cause shall not be negated by the initiation of renewal proceedings by the cable operator. <p>Prohibits cable operators, satellite cable programming vendors in which such operators have an attributable interest, or satellite broadcast programming vendors from engaging in unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts the purpose of which is to hinder or prevent any MVPD from providing satellite cable or broadcast programming to subscribers or consumers. <p>Directs the FCC to prescribe regulations to specify prohibited conduct with respect to such programming. <p>Sets forth factors to be considered in determining whether an exclusive contract for satellite cable or broadcast programming between a cable operator and a programming vendor in which the operator has an attributable interest is in the public interest. Terminates the prohibition on exclusive contracts ten years after this Act's enactment date unless the FCC finds such prohibition necessary to protect competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming. <p>Provides for the commencement of adjudicatory proceedings by MVPDs aggrieved by violations of regulations. <p>Makes regulations inapplicable to contracts that grant exclusive distribution rights with respect to satellite cable programming that were entered into before June 1, 1990, except for prohibitions on practices that prevent an MPVD from obtaining programming from a vendor in which an operator has an attributable interest for distribution to persons in areas not served by a cable operator.  Provides that such exception shall not apply to renewals of such contracts. <p>Increases penalties for theft of cable service. <p>Defines for purposes of customer privacy right provisions (with exceptions):  (1) ""other service"" to include any wire or radio communications service provided using any of the facilities of a cable operator that are used in the provision of cable service; and (2) ""cable operator"" to include any person who is owned or controlled by, or under common ownership or control with, a cable operator, and who provides any wire or radio communications service. <p>Directs the FCC, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to prescribe revisions to rules concerning equal employment opportunity. Requires such revisions to be designed to promote equality of employment opportunities for females and minorities within any corporation, partnership, joint-stock company, or trust engaged primarily in the management or operation of any cable system. <p>Lists specified positions to which such equal opportunity requirements shall apply, ranging from corporate officers to unskilled laborers and service workers. Requires work groups within such cable entities with more than five full-time employees to file with the FCC an annual statistical report identifying by race, sex, and job title the number of employees in each category covered under the equal opportunity requirements.  Outlines other report requirements and increases the fines for failure to use best efforts in meeting such equal opportunity requirements. <p>Bars the FCC from revising equal employment opportunity regulations currently applicable to TV broadcast station licensees and permittees. Provides for a midterm review of such licensees' employment practices. <p>Directs the FCC to report to the Congress on the effect and operation of procedures, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines concerning equal employment opportunity in the cable and broadcasting industries. <p>Provides that any civil action challenging the constitutionality of provisions concerning carriage of local commercial or noncommercial educational TV stations shall be heard by a district court. Provides that any action holding such a provision unconstitutional shall be reviewable as a matter of right by direct appeal to the Supreme Court if such appeal is filed within 20 days after such holding. <p>Limits the liability (to provide only for injunctive and declaratory relief) of franchising authorities with respect to claims arising from the regulation of cable service or from a decision of approval or disapproval concerning a grant, renewal, transfer, or amendment of a franchise. <p>Directs the FCC to:  (1) initiate a rulemaking proceeding to impose public interest or other requirements on direct satellite systems providing video programming; and (2) require, as a condition of initial authorization or renewal for a direct broadcast satellite service providing video programming, that the provider of such service reserve between four and seven percent of the channel capacity of such service exclusively for noncommercial programming of an educational or informational nature. <p>Authorizes a provider of direct broadcast satellite service to utilize for any purpose any unused channel capacity pending the use of such channel capacity for noncommercial programming. <p>Directs such providers to meet such requirements by making channel capacity available to national educational programming suppliers. Prohibits such providers from exercising any editorial control over any video programming provided pursuant to such requirements. <p>Requires the FCC to conduct an ongoing study on the carriage of local, regional, and national sports programming by broadcast stations, cable programming networks, and pay-per-view services and report to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. <p>Directs the FCC, in conducting such study, to analyze the extent to which preclusive contracts between college athletic conferences and video programming vendors have artificially and unfairly restricted the supply of sporting events of local colleges for broadcast on local television stations. <p>Specifies that nothing in this Act shall be construed to alter or restrict the applicability of any Federal or State antitrust law.",,,,,,
