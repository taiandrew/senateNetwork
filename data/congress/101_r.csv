Establishes the Federal National Pay System (the NS Pay System) which shall have 11 grades designated NS-10 through NS-20 each with a range of rates of basic pay for positions currently classified at grades GS-5 through GS-15 for those classes of positions for which the Government recruits nationally, whose incumbents are usually college graduates, and which are generally professional or administrative in nature. Establishes the Federal Locality Pay System (the LS Pay System) which shall have 15 grades designated LS-1 through LS-15 each with a range of rates of basic pay in each pay area for positions currently classified at grades GS-1 through GS-15 for those classes of positions for which the Government recruits locally, whose incumbents are not usually college graduates, and which are generally clerical or technical in nature.  States that it is the policy of the Government that pay for the NS and LS Pay Systems shall be based on the principles that:  (1) NS and LS pay rates shall be competitive with the pay of employees in the non-Federal sector for the same levels of work; (2) pay for individual employees shall be tied to performance; (3) there shall be equal pay for substantially equal work under the NS Pay System and in each pay area under the LS Pay System as is currently required under the General Schedule; and (4) pay distinctions shall be maintained in keeping with work distinctions.  Authorizes the President to establish minimum and maximum NS pay rates and to keep the overall percentage adjustments in LS pay rates below authorized levels when necessary because of a national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare.  Prohibits the maximum rate of basic pay from exceeding the minimum rate by more than 40 percent of the minimum rate payable for each range of rates of basic pay for each grade under such Systems.  Prohibits the rates of basic pay for such Systems from exceeding the rate paid for level V of the Executive Schedule.  Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to determine under which such System each class of positions shall be placed to best meet the personnel management needs of the Government. Requires the position classification standards to specify under which System the positions were placed. <p>Provides for the classification of positions exceeding NS-20 in difficulty and responsibility into one senior NS category.  Authorizes OPM to:  (1) require executive agencies to obtain its approval to classify a position above NS-20; or (2) impose numerical limitations on the number of positions exceeding NS-20 in each agency.  Sets the minimum rate for the senior NS category at 120 percent of the minimum rate for NS-20 and the maximum rate at level V of the Executive Schedule.  Makes the employees in this category eligible for the differentials, allowances, and bonuses provided by this Act.  Prohibits application of provisions regarding pay adjustment, pay rate setting, and merit increases to such employees.  Excludes positions in the Senior Executive Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration Senior Executive Service from such category. <p>Directs the President to designate an executive branch official as the President's Pay Agent.  Provides for annual adjustments by the President to the minimum and maximum rates of basic pay for each grade of the NS Pay System each January based on the recommendations of the President's Pay Agent determined from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) surveys of non-Federal rates of pay for comparable work to insure the competitiveness of NS pay rates. Directs the President to report to the Congress:  (1) when a national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare require that pay be held below the comparability range (the range encompassing amounts ten percent above and below the non-Federal rates of pay reported by BLS surveys); and (2) his or her assessment of the impact of such decision on the Government's ability to recruit and retain well-qualified employees.  Requires the Pay Agent to:  (1) establish a National Employees Pay Council to consist of representatives of Federal employee unions granted consultation rights by OPM; (2) give thorough consideration to the views of the Council in making pay adjustment recommendations and to convene public hearings to obtain the views of interested parties on such recommendations; and (3) determine what rates within such comparability range would be appropriate to allow agencies to recruit and retain well-qualified employees based on certain factors including turnover and unemployment rates. <p>Directs OPM to:  (1) establish pay areas for employees under the LS Pay System based on such factors as local labor market patterns, communicating patterns, and practices of other employers; (2) request BLS surveys of non-Federal rates of pay in each pay area for work comparable to the work performed by such employees; (3) recommend to the Pay Agent the minimum and maximum rates of basic pay for each grade of the LS Pay System in each pay area; and (4) set pay for overseas LS employees.  Provides for annual adjustments by the President under the same guidelines established for the NS Pay System.  Establishes the Federal Labor-Management Committee to advise OPM in establishing pay areas, requesting surveys, and making recommendations to the Pay Agent. <p>Directs OPM to put the new LS pay rates into effect each January. <p>Provides for setting individual rates of basic pay under the NS and LS Pay Systems as is currently done for employees under the General Schedule except that new appointments above the minimum rate for certain individuals are permitted at all grades (currently they are restricted to GS-11 and above) with the approval of OPM only for appointments in an executive agency (currently all appointments except with respect to those by the Librarian of Congress must be approved by OPM).  Sets forth guidelines for setting individual rates of basic pay for:  (1) employees promoted or transferred to a position in a higher grade; (2) employees repromoted or transferred to a grade in which they formerly served; (3) certain legislative branch employees; (4) Defense Department overseas teachers; and (5) employees of county committees under provisions providing financial assistance to agricultural producers for carrying out conservation and environmental enhancement measures. <p>Provides that any employee under the NS and LS Pay Systems whose most recent performance rating was at  the fully successful level or higher shall, at the time of any annual adjustment by the President, receive a merit increase equal to the increase in the minimum rate of basic pay for the employee's grade under such adjustment.

Permits the Administrator to prohibit such exports only if:  (1) the country has indicated that it does not wish to import the pesticide pursuant to an international system of pesticide controls adopted by an international agency (if the United States is a member and has consented to the system) or reached through an agreement to which the United States is a signatory; (2) all registrations of the pesticide or registrations for a significant number of the pesticide's uses have been suspended, cancelled, or denied based on environmental or health effect concerns; and (3) the country has certified that it will not produce the pesticide for use in the country and will not import the pesticide from any other country. <p>Establishes a Pesticide Advisory Board to advise the Administrator or the Scientific Advisory Panel on FIFRA matters involving special expertise. <p>Directs the Administrator, working with the Secretary of Agriculture, to identify those pests that must be brought under control and the chemical, biological, and alternative control measures available to control such pests.  Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Administrator on:  (1) the pests and measures and the areas where a number of registered pesticides and other pest control alternatives is small enough to pose a risk to effective pest control or where pest resistance to current pest control measures has been detected; and (2) research and extension efforts to develop pest control methods for such areas. <p>Directs the Secretary to furnish to the Administrator on an ongoing basis information on the use of pesticides in commercial-scale agricultural production and in the storage, transportation, and processing of food.  Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to furnish to the Administrator on an ongoing basis information on the representative actual levels of pesticide residues on food items.  Provides that such information shall ensure that information on the approximate actual level of human dietary exposure to pesticides is readily available to the Administrator.  Directs the Administrator to establish a program for the storage, management, retrieval, and utilization of such information and to use such information in making decisions under FIFRA and FDCA. Requires the Administrator to assume, if information regarding actual use and residue levels has not been made available, that a pesticide results in dietary residues on food at the highest level permitted under a FDCA tolerance or exemption.  Authorizes appropriations. <p>Makes technical amendments to administrative provisions concerning registrations and judicial review. <p><b>Title II:  Amendments to Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</b> - Amends the FDCA to provide that pesticide residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food do not make the food adulterated.  Revises provisions concerning adulterated food. <p>Deems pesticide chemical residues in or on a food to be unsafe unless a tolerance, or exemption to a tolerance, is in effect with respect to the chemical residue and the concentration of the residue is in the limits of the tolerance.  Provides that:  (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on processed foods without separate tolerances shall not be considered unsafe so long as the residue level is within the tolerance limit for the raw agricultural commodity from which the food was made; and (2) residues in or on processed foods made from raw agricultural commodities for which a residue exemption is in effect shall not be considered unsafe.  Provides that residues of degradation products of precursor substances that are pesticide chemicals shall not be considered unsafe if:  (1) the combined residues of the precursor substance and the degradation products are within the level of the tolerance for the precursor substance; or (2) an exemption is in effect for the precursor substance and the tolerance or exemption does not state that it applies solely to the precursor chemical. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance or exemption from a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue.  Prohibits a tolerance from being established at a level higher than a level that the Administrator determines will protect public health.  Requires the Administrator to modify or revoke such higher tolerances.  Provides that a tolerance will protect the public health if the dietary risk posed to food consumers is not greater than negligible. Establishes thresholds for negligible risks with respect to adverse health and carcinogenic risks. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to establish a tolerance for a residue that results in a greater than negligible risk if:  (1) use of the pesticide producing the residue protects humans or the environment from adverse effects that would result in greater risks than the dietary risk from the chemical; (2) use of the chemical avoids risks to the public or the environment that would result from the use of another pesticide chemical on the same food and that are greater than the dietary exposure risk from the residue; or (3) the unavailability of the chemical would reduce the availability to food consumers of an adequate and economical domestic supply of the food and the adverse economic or health effects to consumers would outweigh the dietary risk from the residue.  Prohibits such tolerances from being issued, or revocations of such tolerances from being denied, unless:  (1) the Administrator has assessed the extent to which efforts are being made to develop alternative methods of pest control or alternative pesticide chemicals for use on the food or commodity that would meet risk exposure requirements; (2) the tolerance is limited to a period of five years; and (3) the Administrator has proposed the issuance or denial in accordance with specified administrative requirements. <p>Prohibits a tolerance from being established unless there is a practical method for detecting and measuring the levels of the pesticide residue in or on the food. <p>Permits exemptions to tolerances to be made only if the Administrator determines that a tolerance is not needed to protect the public health. <p>Permits persons to petition for the establishment, modification, or revocation of a tolerance or exemption.  Sets forth petitioning procedures and judicial review provisions. <p>Entitles tolerance or exemption information submitted to the Administrator under FDCA and registration information submitted under FIFRA to confidential treatment, with specified exceptions. <p>Requires the Administrator to revoke or suspend tolerances consistent with, and following, the cancellation or suspension of a pesticide's registration under FIFRA. <p>Permits delays of the effective dates of a modification or revocation of a tolerance, subject to certain conditions. <p>Requires the Administrator to collect fees for functions regarding the establishment, modification, or revocation of tolerances and exemptions. <p>Prohibits States or political subdivisions from enforcing any limit on a pesticide residue unless the limit is identical to the Federal tolerance or exemption for the residue.  Authorizes the Administrator to grant States the authority to establish more stringent residue limits if such limits are warranted by special local circumstances.  Permits the Administrator to treat such authority as a petition to modify or revoke a tolerance. <p>Authorizes appropriations for increased monitoring by the Secretary of Health and Human Services of pesticide residues in imported and domestic foods. <p><b>Title III:  Amendments to Poultry Products Inspection Act</b> - Amends the Poultry Products Inspection Act to make a conforming amendment to provide that pesticide residues in or on raw agricultural commodities or processed foods do not make the food adulterated.  Deems commodities or processed foods containing residues that are unsafe under FDCA standards to be adulterated. <p><b>Title IV:  Amendments to Federal Meat Inspection Act</b> - Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to make amendments parallel to those made to the Poultry Products Inspection Act. <p><b>Title V:  Amendments to Egg Products Inspection Act</b> - Amends the Egg Products Inspection Act to make amendments parallel to those made to the Poultry Products Inspection Act.",,,,,,

Calendar No. 821.",,"<p>Cable Television Consumer Protection Act of 1990 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit any Federal agency, State, or franchising authority from regulating either the rates for the provision of cable service or for the installation or rental of equipment used for the receipt of cable service, except as provided under this Act. <p>Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), if it finds that a cable system is not subject to effective competition, to ensure that the rates that such system provides for basic cable service, including the installation or rental of equipment used for the receipt of such basic service, are reasonable. <p>Directs the FCC, upon written request by a franchising authority, to review the State and local laws and regulations governing the regulation of cable systems under the jurisdiction of such franchising authority. Allows the FCC to authorize the franchising authority to carry out such regulation in lieu of the FCC in certain instances.  Directs the FCC, upon request by a cable operator or other interested party, to review regulation of cable system rates established by a franchising authority authorized by the FCC. <p>Allows a cable operator to add or delete from a basic cable service tier any video programming other than retransmitted local television broadcast signals.  Directs the FCC to prescribe procedures, standards, requirements, and guidelines for the establishment of reasonable rates for basic cable service by a cable operator not subject to effective competition.  Authorizes a cable operator to file with the FCC a request for a rate increase in basic cable tier service.  Considers such request granted if not acted upon within 180 days. <p>Directs the FCC to prescribe:  (1) criteria for determining whether rates for cable programming services are significantly excessive; and (2) criteria for determining that a complaint has been properly filed objecting to such rates and establishing that such rates are significantly excessive.  Outlines factors for making such determinations.  Presumes a cable system to be subject to effective competition if:  (1) fewer than 30 percent of the households in the cable community subscribe to the cable service of the system; or (2) the cable community is served by a sufficient number of local television broadcast signals and by more than one multichannel video programming distributor. (MVPD).  Outlines the circumstances under which a cable community shall be considered to be served by more than one MVPD. <p>Prohibits a video programmer in which a cable operator has an attributable interest and who licenses video programming for national distribution from:  (1) unreasonably refusing to deal with any MVPD; or (2) discriminating in the price, terms, and sale conditions among cable systems, operators, or other MVPDs if such action would impede retail competition.  Allows such a programmer to:  (1) impose reasonable requirements for creditworthiness, service, and financial stability; (2) establish different prices, terms, and conditions to take into account certain objective cost factors; and (3) permit price differentials which are made in good faith to meet the low price of a competitor.  Prohibits a cable operator, system, or its affiliate from discriminating against any unaffiliated video programmer or requiring a financial interest as a condition of carriage on a cable system. <p>Requires any person who encrypts any satellite cable programming for private viewing to make such programming available for private viewing by C-band receive-only home satellite antenna users. <p>States as one of the purposes of the Communications Act of 1934 the promotion of competition in the delivery of diverse sources of video programming. <p>Authorizes the FCC to:  (1) determine maximum reasonable rates a cable operator may establish for the commercial use of designated channel capacity; and (2) establish reasonable terms and conditions for such use. <p>Directs the FCC to establish reasonable limits on the number of: (1) cable subscribers that may be reached through cable systems owned by one person; and (2) channels of a cable system that can be occupied by a video programmer in which a cable operator has an attributable interest. <p>Makes it unlawful for a cable operator to hold a license for a multi-channel multipoint distribution service, or to offer satellite master antenna television service separate and apart from any franchised cable service, in any portion of the cable community served by that cable operator's cable system.  Directs the FCC to waive such prohibition in certain instances. Directs the FCC to regulate the outside ownership of MVPDs if ten percent of U.S. households with television sets subscribe to service provided by such MVPDs directly via home satellite antennas. Requires access to such satellite service by unaffiliated video programmers in such case. <p>Requires the FCC to determine whether the cable industry has established industry standards for response by cable operators to customer concerns and whether such standards are effective in ensuring customer satisfaction.  Requires the FCC to establish such standards if they are found to be faulty. <p>Allows a franchising authority six months to act upon a franchise renewal application of a cable operator.  States that any lawful action to revoke a cable operator's franchise for cause shall not be negotiated by the initiation of renewal proceedings by the cable operator. <p>Gives the FCC authority to require that television sets wired for cable television be equipped with an electronic switch allowing users to readily change among all video distribution media.  Requires such switch to be included only if the FCC determines that its installation is technically and economically feasible. <p>Provides that, in any First Amendment claim against a franchising authority or governmental entity arising from actions expressly authorized or required under title VI of the Communications Act of 1934, any relief shall be limited to injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorney's fees and legal costs, with certain exceptions. <p>Directs the FCC to establish minimum technical standards to ensure adequate signal quality for all classes of video programming signals provided over a cable system and to periodically update such standards to reflect improvements in technology.  Directs the FCC to establish procedures for handling complaints or allegations that such standards have not been met.  Prohibits a State, franchising authority, or other governmental entity from establishing any other technical standards once the FCC has done so. <p>Requires each cable operator that relies upon compulsory licensing for secondary transmissions by its cable system (known hereafter as a participating operator) to carry the signals of qualified local broadcast stations (local non-cable stations) in accordance with this Act.  Requires each participating operator to carry a specified number of qualified local broadcast stations, such number increasing with the amount of usable activated channels of such participating operator.  Requires, among the signals of qualified local broadcast stations to be carried by each participating operator, the carriage of signals of at least:  (1) one qualified noncommercial educational television station for an operator with fewer than 54 usable activated channels; and (2) two such stations for an operator with 54 or more usable active channels.  Allows a participating operator discretion in selecting which local broadcast signals shall be carried on its cable system once the minimum number of qualified local broadcast stations presented on its system exceeds the minimum number required under this Act, with specified conditions. Makes the carriage of the minimum required number of noncommercial educational television stations nondiscretionary.  Requires, when feasible, the signal of the qualified local broadcast station on the cable system to be carried on the same channel on which the local broadcast station is normally carried over the air or upon a channel mutually agreed upon by the broadcaster and the principal operator.  Outlines other required standards for the retransmission by a principal operator of the qualified local broadcast stations required under this Act.  Requires local signals carried in fulfillment of this Act to be carried on the lowest-priced tier of basic cable service offered by the participating operator.  Requires a participating operator to:  (1) identify, upon request, those local broadcast signals carried on its system in fulfillment of requirements of this Act; and (2) provide written notice to a qualified local broadcast station, the franchising authority of such cable system, and subscribers of such system at least 30 days prior to either deleting or repositioning such signal on its cable system.  Prohibits a participating operator from accepting money or other consideration for the carriage of local broadcast signals as required under this Act. <p>Authorizes a qualified local broadcast station to file a complaint with the FCC when it believes that a participating operator is not complying with signal carriage requirements enumerated under this Act. Outlines administrative procedures for FCC review and rulings on such complaints. <p>Provides that any civil action challenging the provision of this Act relating to the carriage of local broadcast signals by cable operators shall be heard by a district court.  Provides that any action holding such a provision unconstitutional shall be reviewable as a matter of right by direct appeal to the Supreme Court if such appeal is filed within 20 days after such holding. <p>Directs the FCC to prescribe rules and regulations concerning the disposition, after a cable subscriber terminates service, of any cable installed by the operator within the premises of such subscriber.",,,,,,

Details conditions which will cause such stay to expire.  Prohibits a Federal court, if one of such conditions has occurred, from entering a stay of execution or granting relief in a capital case unless:  (1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not previously presented in the State or Federal courts; (2) the failure to raise the claim was the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, was the result of a recognition by the Supreme Court of a new Federal right that is retroactively applicable, or is due to the fact that the claim is based on facts that could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review; and (3) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt on the offense for which the death penalty was imposed. <p>Imposes time limits on filing for habeas corpus relief.  Requires such time limits to be tolled under specified conditions. <p>Requires the district court, upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, to rule on the merits of the claims properly before it. <p>Makes the requirement for a certificate of probable cause inapplicable, with an exception.",,,,,,

Directs the court to issue the death sentence if recommended. <p>Requires the court to instruct the jury:  (1) not to consider the race, color, national origin, creed, or sex of the defendant or any victim in its consideration of the sentence; and (2) that it is never required to return a death sentence. <p>Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence.  Requires the Court of Appeals, upon considering the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if: (1) the sentence was not imposed under influence of passion, prejudice, or arbitrariness; and (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors.  Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. <p>Sets forth provisions governing implementation of a death sentence. Prohibits the execution of a woman while she is pregnant or of a person who is mentally retarded or disabled under specified criteria. Prohibits requiring any employee of any State department of corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or any provider of services under contract to participate in any execution if contrary to his or her moral or religious convictions. <p>Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death. <p>Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for:  (1) murders committed by prisoners in Federal correctional institutions; (2) kidnappings which result in the death of any person; (3) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (4) ""murder for hire""; (5) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (6) engaging in a criminal enterprise activity which results in death; and (7) other specified offenses. <p>Racial Justice Act of 1989 - Amends the Federal judicial code to make it unlawful to impose or execute sentences of death under color of State or Federal law in a racially discriminatory pattern. Prohibits a person from being put to death in the execution of a sentence imposed pursuant to any law if that person's death sentence furthers a racially discriminatory pattern. <p>Provides that ordinary methods of statistical proof shall suffice to establish a racially discriminatory pattern.  States that it shall not be necessary to show discriminatory motive, intent, or purpose on the part of any individual or institution. <p>Establishes the requirements for a prima facie showing that a racially discriminatory pattern exists.  States that a State or Federal entity may rebut a prima facie showing by establishing by clear and convincing evidence that identifiable nonracial factors explain the racial disparities constituting the pattern. <p>Requires any State or Federal entity that provides for the imposition of the death penalty to collect and maintain pertinent data on the charging, disposition, and sentencing patterns for all cases of death-eligible crimes. <p>Provides for the appointment of counsel for all indigent clients (and the furnishing of investigative and other services) for habeas corpus actions arising under this Act.  Provides that no State court determination on the merits of a factual issue pertinent to a claim under this Act shall be presumed to be correct unless:  (1) the State has collected and maintained the necessary death penalty data; and (2) the determination was made in a court proceeding where the defendant was afforded his rights required under this Act. <p>States that nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to affect the lawfulness of any sentence of death that does not violate this Act. <p>States that the failure to raise such a claim before the enactment of this Act shall not bar future claims.",,,,,,
