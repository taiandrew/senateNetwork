Department of Labor </em>dismissed a complaint by a civil servant against the NRC for discriminating against the civil servant for whistleblowing activities on the grounds that the act does not waive sovereign immunity (i.e., the federal government's immunity from the jurisdiction of U.S. courts). Specifically, the court held that (1) the whistleblower protections in the&nbsp;act authorize complaints against persons (e.g., corporate employers) that discriminate against their employees, and (2) federal employers like DOE and the NRC are not considered to be persons.</p><p>The bill modifies the act to waive sovereign immunity by clarifying that the whistleblower protections apply to employees of any <em>employer—</em>not just a <em>person</em><em>—</em>that discharges or otherwise discriminates against its employee for being a whistleblower&nbsp;of nuclear safety violations. Thus, the bill includes civil servants under the act's whistleblower protections on nuclear safety violations.&nbsp;</p><!--tinycomments|2.1|data:application/json;base64,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-->",,,,,,
