Prohibits such exports (including pesticides used for agricultural production) unless: (1) the pesticide is registered; or (2) all of the active ingredients in the pesticide are the subject of a food tolerance. <p>Requires exporters, prior to the shipment of certain pesticides, to provide specified information to the Administrator.  Prohibits the exportation of any pesticide to a country of use that:  (1) has refused consent; or (2) has given conditional consent unless the conditions on which the consent was given are met.  Prohibits refusals to consent unless the country certifies that it is not producing or importing and will not produce or import the pesticide or a similar product with the same active ingredient. <p>Waives requirements described above, upon the request of a country of use and subject to certain determinations by the Administrator, to permit the export of pesticides not meeting FIFRA requirements to: (1) prevent or arrest the spread of a communicable disease; or (2) stop or prevent the spread of a pest that is destroying or will destroy quantities of the country's food supply so as to result in widespread famine. <p>Permits the export of pesticides for experimental use in foreign countries if specified conditions are met. <p>Directs the Administrator to submit information to the Secretary of Health and Human Services concerning inspection for pesticide residues in imported foods conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services. <p>Requires the Administrator to notify foreign countries and the International Register of Potentially Toxic Chemicals whenever regulatory action is taken with respect to a pesticide. <p>Directs the Administrator to:  (1) convene meetings with foreign governments and other interested parties to promote the implementation of improved research and regulatory programs for pest management and strategies for sustainable agriculture and to encourage the adoption of a multilateral convention requiring standard notice and pesticide export control measures; and (2) provide foreign countries with technical assistance to develop pesticide regulatory programs. <p>Permits persons to bring civil actions to secure the imposition of penalties on persons who violate pesticide export requirements.

Requires the summary to:  (1) be made by food product, country of origin, port of entry, pesticides monitored by the Secretary, pesticide residues detected, and the quantity of each pesticide exported from the United States for agricultural use; and (2) indicate the volume of each type of food tested for pesticide residues, arranged by pesticide, food, and country of origin. <p><b>Title III:  Pesticide Tolerances</b> - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Administrator, if a registration under FIFRA for a pesticide to be used on food is canceled or modified to prohibit its use in connection with food, to revoke any tolerance or exemption that permits the presence of the pesticide on the food. Suspends tolerances or exemptions for pesticides used on food if such use is suspended under FIFRA. <p>Authorizes the Administrator, if a residue of a canceled or suspended pesticide will persist in the environment and be present on a food, to establish a tolerance for the pesticide at a level that permits the residue to remain and will protect public health.  Requires the Administrator to reduce the tolerance for any suspended or canceled pesticide annually if any decrease in the pesticide's residual environmental contamination or residues on food has occurred.

Requires such importers, if unreported pesticides are detected in such commodities, to submit residue analyses for such pesticides.  Waives reporting requirements for unreported pesticides if the presence of such pesticides is attributable to long-term environmental persistence and does not pose a health risk.      Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act to apply such requirements to importers of meat, poultry, and eggs. <p>(Sec. 402) Amends the Agricultural Act of 1954 to add to the list of annual reporting requirements of agricultural attaches a report on the customary use of pesticides in the production of agricultural commodities in foreign countries. <p><b>Title V:  Effective Dates</b> - Sets forth the effective dates for provisions of this Act.",,,,,,

Requires the approval of the Attorney General or the Attorney General's designee to prosecute a juvenile between the ages of 13 and 16. (Under current law, the decision to charge a juvenile as an adult for specified crimes is a result of a motion by the United States to transfer the juvenile for criminal prosecution, and the offenses subject to this transfer authority are limited.) <p>Makes a determination regarding approval or institution of prosecution under this title non-reviewable in court, with exceptions. <p>Allows a juvenile to be prosecuted and convicted as an adult for any other offense which is properly joined under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and convicted of a lesser included offense. <p>(Sec. 1211) Limits the applicability of statutory minimum sentences in certain prosecutions of persons under age 16. <p>(Sec. 1213) Requires:  (1) an arresting officer to promptly take reasonable steps to notify the parents, guardian, or custodian of a juvenile taken into custody (current law requires immediate notification of such parties and the Attorney General); and (2) the juvenile to be taken before a judicial officer without unreasonable delay (current law prohibits a juvenile from being detained for longer than a reasonable period before being brought before a magistrate). <p>(Sec. 1215) Requires juvenile delinquency proceedings for a juvenile in detention to begin within 45 (currently, 30) days after the beginning of such detention. <p>Directs the court, in determining whether an information should be dismissed with or without prejudice, to consider the seriousness of the offense, the facts and circumstances of the case that led to the dismissal, and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of justice. <p>(Sec. 1216) Modifies sentencing options under the code to make available increased detention, fines, and supervised release for adjudicated delinquents.  Makes mandatory restitution applicable to adjudicated delinquents.  Increases, for an adjudicated delinquent, the maximum period of:  (1) probation to the same period applicable to an adult; and (2) official detention to the lesser of the maximum term of imprisonment authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult, ten years, or the date on which the juvenile attains age 26. <p>Authorizes the court, pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission, to treat the conviction as adult of juveniles aged 13, 14, and 15 as an adjudication of delinquency.

Requires NAS to submit to the congressional veterans and defense committees (designated committees) a report specifying all agents, hazards, or medicines considered.  Directs NAS, after such identification, to determine whether a statistical association exists between exposure to such agent, hazard, or medicine and the illness.  Requires NAS to separately review potential treatment models for such illnesses, make recommendations for additional studies, and perform subsequent reviews of available evidence and data.  Requires periodic reports from NAS to the Secretary, the Secretary of Defense, and the designated committees concerning NAS activities. <p>Terminates requirements and activities under this Act ten years after NAS submits its first report. <p>Requires the Secretary to enter into an agreement with an alternative scientific organization if agreement cannot be reached with NAS. <p>(Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a plan for the establishment and operation of a single computerized information database for the collection, storage, and analysis of information on illnesses and health care utilization patterns of Gulf War veterans.  Requires such plan to be submitted to the Secretary of Defense, NAS, and the designated committees.  Directs NAS to evaluate and report on such plan.

Preempts any State law, regulation, or order that results in unbundled local distribution service that is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential. <p>Authorizes a State or State commission to bar an electric utility from selling electric energy to an ultimate consumer using local distribution facilities if such utility or any of its affiliates owns or controls local distribution facilities and is not itself providing unbundled local distribution service. <p>Declares that nothing in this Act shall prohibit a State or State regulatory authority from assessing a nondiscriminatory charge on unbundled local distribution service, the retail sale of electric energy, or the generation of electric energy for consumption by the generator within the State. <p>(Sec. 5) Expresses the sense of the Congress that:  (1) every electric energy consumer should have access to electric energy at reasonable and affordable rates; and (2) FERC and the States should ensure that competition in the electric energy business does not result in the loss of service to rural, residential, or low-income consumers. <p>Requires any State or State commission that requires an electric utility subject to its jurisdiction to provide unbundled local distribution service to:  (1) consider adopting measures to implement such policy; and (2) report to FERC on any measures so adopted. <p>(Sec. 6) Instructs FERC to establish and enforce national electric reliability standards to ensure the reliability of the electric transmission system.  Authorizes FERC to:  (1) designate national and regional councils to promote such reliability; (2) incorporate into its own standards the operational standards adopted by such councils; and (3) enforce compliance with such standards on the part of any public or transmitting utility. <p>(Sec. 7) Prescribes procedural guidelines under which FERC may order a transmitting utility to broaden or improve its facilities for the interstate transmission of electric energy. <p>(Sec. 8) Authorizes FERC to order the formation of a regional transmission system, and to order any transmitting utility operating within such region to participate in it.  Requires FERC to appoint a regional oversight board to oversee such system operation, and such board to appoint an independent system operator to operate the system. <p>(Sec. 9) Establishes civil penalties for violations of this Act. <p>(Sec. 10) Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to prohibit any State or State authority from barring a State regulated electric utility from recovering the cost of electric energy the utility is required to purchase from a qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power production facility.",,,,,,

Enhances penalties for discharging or using a firearm to cause serious bodily injury. <p>(Sec. 2124) Increases penalties for:  (1) transferring a handgun or ammunition to a juvenile; and (2) firearms conspiracy. <p><b>Part 3:  Targeting Illicit Gun Markets</b> - Makes specified firearms offenses predicates to a violation of RICO. <p>(Sec. 2132) Makes it a felony for Federal licensees to violate requirements which are tantamount to aiding and abetting unlawful deliveries or purchases of firearms, such as:  (1) selling firearms to persons known to be juveniles or who reside out of State; and (2) making false statements to a licensee in relation to the acquisition of a firearm and knowingly selling a firearm to a convicted felon or other prohibited category of firearm recipient. <p>(Sec. 2133) Prohibits any licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer from storing any firearms in its business inventory in a manner not in conformity with regulations issued by the Secretary.

(Current law does not distinguish between juveniles under or over age 16 and requires detention prior to disposition in a foster home or community based facility located in or near the juvenile's home community.) <p>Expands current protections for juveniles detained prior to disposition to cover detention prior to sentencing and to include provision for reasonable safety and security. <p>(Sec. 6002) Amends code provisions regarding commitment to:  (1) prohibit the Attorney General from causing any person under age 18 adjudicated delinquent, or under age 16 convicted of an offense, to be placed or retained in an adult jail or correctional facility in which the person has regular contact with adults incarcerated because they have been convicted of a crime or are awaiting trial on criminal charges, except for placement in a community-based facility (current law bars such contact with respect to any juvenile and does not contain such exception); and (2) provide for reasonable safety and security for every juvenile adjudicated delinquent. <p><b>Title VII:  Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention</b> - Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention State and Local Assistance Act of 1997 - <b>Subtitle A:  Creation of the Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention</b> - Amends the Safe Streets Act to establish within the Department of Justice the Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention (replacing the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention) which shall establish and administer policies and programs to address:  (1) the reduction control, and prosecution of juvenile crime; (2) the juvenile justice system; (3) youth violence; and (4) other purposes consistent with this Act. <p>Authorizes the Attorney General to establish a Coordinating Council on Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention to:  (1) ensure coordination and cooperation among Federal agencies with jurisdiction over juvenile and youth programs; (2) ensure that juvenile crime prevention programs are complementary and not duplicative; and (3) offer program and policy advice to the President and executive agencies. <p>Sets forth provisions regarding:  (1) withholding grant funds for non-compliance with this title; (2) confidentiality of program records; (3) restrictions on the use of funds; and (4) continuation of rules and authorities of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and of proceedings commenced by or against the Government before the enactment of this title.

Prohibits such an operator from flying in the airspace over a NPS unit covered by a plan unless the operator enters into an agreement with the Director and the Administrator specifying otherwise. <p>(Sec. 5) Requires the Director, for NPS units that, as of January 1, 1997, experienced no such overflights, to:  (1) prescribe criteria to identify NPS units where such flights would be incompatible with or injurious to the units; and (2) designate the units which meet those criteria as flight-free park units. <p>(Sec. 6) Requires the Administrator to issue a regulation governing the operation of all commercial air tour flights over NPS units. Allows the Administrator to issue regulations that prescribe separate operational rules governing flights by fixed-wing aircraft and by rotorcraft. <p>(Sec. 7) Directs the Administrator to initiate proceedings to revise the regulations relating to air taxi operators and commercial operators to specifically cover all commercial air tour flights over NPS units and to address safety and environmental issues. <p>Requires each commercial air tour aircraft to display specified identification marks. <p>Requires the Administrator to ensure that aeronautical charts display the boundaries, airspace management plan, operational rule, or Special Federal Aviation Regulation with respect to each unit. <p>Directs:  (1) the Administrator to study requiring commercial air tour aircraft operating in the airspace over NPS units to have on board an automatic flight tracking system capable of monitoring altitude and ground position; and (2) the Administrator and the Director, if the Administrator determines the use of such system is feasible and advisable, to jointly develop a plan for implementing a program to monitor such altitude and position. <p>Requires the Administrator to establish and maintain a database concerning commercial air tour aircraft designed to provide data to be used in:  (1) making determinations of the scope of commercial air tour flights, accident rates, and flight safety assessments; and (2) ensuring that each FAA flight standards district office that serves a district in which such flights are conducted is adequately staffed to carry out this Act. <p>(Sec. 8) Exempts from the provisions of this Act:  (1) an aircraft experiencing an in-flight emergency, participating in search and rescue, fire fighting, or police emergency operations, carrying out park administration, or complying with air traffic control instructions; and (2) flights by military aircraft.

Makes a Senate candidate eligible for FECA benefits if the candidate:  (1) files a primary election eligibility certification and declaration; and (2) files a general election eligibility certification and declaration.    Limits Senate primary expenditures for a candidate (or his or her authorized committees) to:  (1) 67 percent of the general election expenditure limit; or (2) $2.75 million.  Limits runoff expenditures. <p>Sets a threshold contribution amount which triggers application of such primary and runoff limits. <p>Limits the total amount of out-of-State contributions accepted by the candidate and the candidate's authorized committees.  Provides for personal or family funds to be treated as out-of-State contributions. <p>Limits the use by a Senate candidate (or authorized committees), during an election cycle, of the candidate's personal (or a member of the candidate's immediate family) funds or proceeds of indebtedness by the candidate (or a member of the candidate's immediate family). <p>Limits aggregate general election expenditures by an eligible Senate candidate (or authorized committees) to the lesser of:  (1) $5.5 million; or (2) the greater of $950,000, or $400,000 plus 30 cents times the voting age population up to 4 million and 25 cents times the voting age population over 4 million. <p>Exempts from the general election expenditure limit expenditures for Federal, State, or local income taxes on the earnings of a candidate's authorized committees. <p>Permits an eligible Senate candidate notified by the Commission that independent expenditures totaling $10,000 or more have been made in the same election favoring another candidate or against the eligible candidate, to spend an amount equal to the amount of the independent expenditures, and any such expenditures shall not be subject to certain limits applicable to the eligible candidate for the election. <p>Entitles eligible Senate candidates to certain broadcast media rates, mailing rates, public financing payments, and in certain circumstances, payments compensating for independent expenditures and excess expenditures (if any) on behalf of the candidate's opponent. <p>Requires that the Commission shall issue a certification of eligibility to receive FECA benefits within seven business days after an eligible Senate candidate files a request with the Secretary of the Senate to receive the benefits. <p>Requires the Commission to examine and audit, for FECA compliance, the campaign accounts of ten percent of all Senate candidates in which there was an eligible Senate candidate on the ballot, and the campaign accounts of all opponents of such candidates as well.  Requires candidates to refund to the Commission any excess payments or expenditures or misused benefits.  Sets civil penalties for excess expenditures and contributions.  Requires deposit of all such amounts into the Senate Election Campaign Fund (established by this Act). <p>Provides for judicial review of Commission actions and requires Commission reports to the Senate. <p>Establishes in the Treasury the Senate Election Campaign Fund, for payments to eligible Senate candidates.

Requires a report to the Secretary of the Senate within 24 hours after aggregate contributions have been received or aggregate expenditures have been made or obligated to be made (or, if later, within 24 hours after the qualification date for the general election ballot) that exceeds 75 percent of the general election expenditure limit. <p>Allows the Commission to make its own determination of whether an ineligible candidate in a general election has raised aggregate contributions, or made or has obligated to make aggregate expenditures in amounts that would require a report. <p>Requires any candidate for the Senate who, during an election cycle, expends more than the personal funds expenditure limit to report to the Secretary of the Senate within 24 hours after expenditures have been made or loans incurred in excess of the personal funds expenditure limit. <p>Requires certain expenditure reports from any Senate candidate who held Federal, State, or local office or was a candidate for any such office during the same election cycle, and made any expenditures, before becoming a Senate candidate, which would have been treated as Senate candidate expenditures. <p>(Sec. 104) Requires Senate candidates ineligible for FECA benefits to place on every paid or authorized political commercial or communication the declaration: ""This candidate has not agreed to voluntary campaign spending limits."" <p><b>Subtitle B:  General Provisions</b> - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a broadcast station to make broadcast time available to all House and Senate candidates in the last 30 (currently 45) days before a primary and the last 45 (currently 60) days before a general election, at the lowest unit charge of the station for the same amount of time (currently, the same class and amount of time) for the same period on the same date.  Limits the rates for the use of a television station by an eligible Senate candidate for the 45 days before a general election to 50 percent of the lowest unit rate. <p>Prohibits broadcasters from preempting advertisements sold to political candidates at the lowest unit rate, unless the preemption is beyond the broadcaster's control. <p>(Sec. 132) Amends Federal law to permit eligible Senate candidates to mail up to one piece per eligible voter (voting age population) at the lowest third-class non-profit postage rate, during a general election period only. <p>(Sec. 133) Amends FECA to revise requirements regarding the publication and distribution of statements and solicitations, including applying the requirements to political committees (currently applies to any person).
