Subtitle A:  General Provisions <p>Bipartisan Welfare Reform Act of 1996 - <b>Title I:  Block Grants for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families</b> - Expresses the sense of the Congress that prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock births are very important Government interests. <p>(Sec. 103) Replaces the current Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program and Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program (JOBS) under, respectively, parts A and F of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) with a program of block grants to the States for temporary assistance for needy families already with or expecting children (TEA program).  Gives such program the stated purpose of increasing the flexibility of States in operating approved statewide programs, with:  (1) certain mandatory work and education requirements (as well as penalties against adult family members on TEA who refuse to engage in various specified work activities); and (2) adult- supervised living arrangements for unmarried teenage parents to enable such families to leave the program and become self-sufficient. Includes participation in community service programs and subsidized public sector employment as TEA program work activities. <p>Requires TEA programs to provide certain time-limited cash assistance (and thereafter vouchers) to eligible families entering into an individual responsibility plan with the State (with certain exceptions involving minor children and hardship situations), outlining their obligations in receiving TEA assistance (such as immunizing their children or finishing high school), as well as the specific services the State will provide (such as job preparation and family planning services and, at the State's option, substance abuse treatment services) to enable them to move into private sector employment. <p>Requires State TEA programs also to:  (1) establish annual numerical goals for preventing and reducing the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, with special emphasis on teenage pregnancies, over a specified ten-year period; and (2) encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. <p>Denies TEA for fugitive felons and probation and parole violators and minor children absent from the home for a significant period. Suspends it for ten years for persons who have fraudulently misrepresented residence to obtain assistance in two or more States. Denies additional cash assistance, as a general rule, for additional children born to families already on TEA (except in cases of rape and incest), unless State law specifically exempts the State TEA program from such denial.  Reduces or denies TEA for noncooperation in child support. <p>Outlines State TEA plan contents.  Provides for the State's choice of treatment of aliens and families moving interstate, and for the exchange of certain plan information about TEA applicants or recipients with law enforcement officers under prescribed conditions. Sets forth requirements for State plan approval by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), which include certifications that the State will operate a child protection and child support enforcement program under SSA title IV parts B and D (Child-Welfare Services Program and Child Support and Establishment of Paternity Program), respectively. <p>Details TEA program grant administrative provisions:  (1) determining the amounts of State grants for family assistance for FY 1996 through 2001; (2) outlining grant uses, including assistance to families in meeting home heating and cooling costs, and a State program under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990; (3) rewarding States with additional grant amounts for reductions in illegitimate births, as well as for population increases and TEA program work activities; and (4) establishing in the Treasury (and providing deposits for) a Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs for payments to certain eligible participating States.  Makes necessary appropriations. <p>Sets up a Federal loan program for certain State TEA programs for anti-fraud and other specified activities.  Makes necessary appropriations. <p>Establishes penalties for States and individual families for specified grant and program violations, respectively, through reduced grants and assistance payments.  Allows States to terminate assistance payments, but prohibits assistance reduction or termination based on a refusal of an adult to work if the adult is a single custodial parent caring for a child under age six and unable to obtain needed child care for one or more specified reasons. <p>Provides for State appeal of Federal adverse decisions with respect to State plans or imposition of penalties. <p>Outlines specific program data collection and reporting requirements, as well as certain research, evaluation, and study requirements.  Makes necessary appropriations. <p>Provides for TEA grants to Indian tribes (with a special rule for Alaskan Native tribes).  Makes necessary appropriations. <p>Directs the Bureau of the Census to expand the Survey of Income and Program Participation to obtain information enabling interested persons to evaluate the impact of this title on a random national sample of State TEA recipients and other appropriate low-income families.  Makes necessary appropriations. <p>Provides for the treatment of current and previously granted State AFDC (welfare reform) waiver projects. <p>Retains the HHS Assistant Secretary for Family Support as the official responsible for administering SSA title IV part A and D programs. <p>Expresses the sense of the Congress encouraging each State operating a TEA program to:  (1) assign the highest priority to requiring adults in two-parent families and in single-parent families with older preschool or school-age children to engage in work activities; and (2) require non-custodial, nonsupporting parents under age 18 to fulfill community work obligations and attend appropriate parenting or money management classes after school. <p>(Sec. 104) Allows States to contract with charitable, religious, or private organizations to provide services and administer programs established or modified by this Act, or to provide program beneficiaries with certificates, vouchers, or other forms of disbursement redeemable with such organizations.  Prohibits the expenditure of financial assistance under such programs for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization. <p>(Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary of Commerce to expand the data collection efforts of the Bureau of the Census to enable it to collect certain data on grandparent caregivers. <p>(Sec. 106) Directs the HHS Secretary to report to the Congress on the status of State automated data processing systems used in administering State programs under SSA title IV part A. <p>(Sec. 107) Requires the HHS Secretary to report to the Congress on outcomes measures for evaluating the success of the States in moving individuals out of the welfare system through employment as an alternative to the minimum participation rates under mandatory TEA work requirements. <p>(Sec. 108) Makes conforming amendments to SSA, the Food Stamp Act of 1977, and related provisions of other specified Federal laws. <p>(Sec. 111) Directs the Commissioner of Social Security (Commissioner) to develop a prototype of a counterfeit-resistant social security card and study and report to the Congress on different methods of improving the social security card application process. <p>(Sec. 112) Requires any organization accepting Federal funds under this Act to disclose that fact in any communication it makes that intends to promote public support or opposition to any Federal, State, or local government policy through any broadcasting station, periodical, or other specified type of general public advertising. Makes any organization failing to make such a disclosure ineligible to receive Federal funds under this Act. <p>(Sec. 113) Amends the Family Support Act of 1988 to remove the ""demonstration"" status of the Job Opportunities for Certain Low-Income Individuals (JOLI) program and give it an increased annual authorization for any fiscal year. <p><b>Title II:  Supplemental Security Income - Subtitle A:  Eligibility Restrictions</b> - Amends SSA title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) to:  (1) deny SSI by reason of disability to drug addicts and alcoholics for whom addiction or alcoholism would be a contributing factor material to the disability determination; (2) revise representative payee and treatment requirements; (3) deny SSI benefits for ten years to individuals found to have fraudulently misrepresented residence in order to obtain benefits simultaneously in two or more States; (4) deny SSI benefits for fugitive felons and probation and parole violators; and (5) outline the process for periodic review with respect to the continuing eligibility of an individual 18 years of age or older to receive certain SSI disability benefits. <p>Provides certain supplemental funding for alcohol and substance abuse treatment programs. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Benefits for Disabled Children</b> - Revises the rules with respect to childhood eligibility, with corresponding changes to childhood SSI regulations modifying the medical criteria for evaluation of mental and emotional disorders, and discontinuing the use of individualized functional assessments for children.  Requires the Commissioner to redetermine the eligibility of any individual under age 18 receiving SSI benefits based on a disability as of the enactment of this Act, and whose eligibility for such benefits may terminate by reason of this Act. <p>(Sec. 212) Provides that at least once every three years the Commissioner shall review the continued SSI eligibility of each individual who has not attained age 18 and is eligible for such benefits by reason of an impairment (or combination of impairments) which may improve (or, which is unlikely to improve, at the option of the Commissioner).  Requires a parent or guardian of a recipient whose case is so reviewed to present evidence that the recipient is and has been receiving treatment of the condition which was the basis for the SSI benefits. <p>Provides that if an individual is eligible for SSI disability benefits for the month preceding the month in which the individual attains age 18, the Commissioner shall redetermine such eligibility: (1) during the one year period beginning on the individual's 18th birthday; and (2) by applying the criteria used in determining the initial eligibility for applicants who have attained age 18. <p>Outlines specific requirements governing:  (1) continuing disability reviews for low birth weight babies; and (2) benefit payments through representative payees to eligible individuals and their spouses. <p>(Sec. 214) Provides for a reduction in cash SSI benefits payable to institutionalized individuals whose medical costs are covered by private insurance. <p>(Sec. 215) Reduces by specified basic needs and earned income disregard allocations the amount of parental income attributed to disabled children. <p><b>Subtitle C:  State Supplementation Programs</b> - Repeals maintenance of effort requirements applicable to optional State programs for supplementation of SSI benefits. <p><b>Subtitle D:  Studies Regarding Supplemental Security Income Program</b> - Requires the Commissioner of Social Security to report annually to the President and the Congress regarding the SSI program and to make arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences, or other independent entity, to study the disability determination process under SSA titles II and XVI for similar reports. <p>(Sec. 233) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report on the:  (1) impact of this title on the SSI program; and (2) extra expenses incurred by families of children receiving SSI benefits that are not covered by other Federal, State, or local programs. <p><b>Subtitle E:  National Commission on the Future of Disability</b> - Establishes the National Commission on the Future of Disability to develop and report to the President and the Congress:   (1) a comprehensive study of all matters related to the nature, purpose, and adequacy of all Federal programs serving individuals with disabilities, including the programs under SSA titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) and XVI; and (2) recommendations for appropriate action.

Program under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) with a Temporary Employment Assistance (TEA) program for the purpose of providing assistance to families with needy children and assisting parents of such children to obtain and retain private sector work to the extent possible, and public sector or volunteer work if necessary, through the Work First Employment Block Grant (WORK) program. Authorizes appropriations. <p>(Sec. 101) Sets forth the elements for State TEA plans to be approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including limits on the length of time for cash assistance, with specified exceptions for teen parents and individuals exempt from certain work requirements under this title because of illness or other specified reasons.  Includes among such elements requirements for the State to assess the skills, prior work experience, and employability of each parent applicant and develop a parent empowerment contract setting forth their job search, work-, and education-related obligations (including, at State option, appropriate substance abuse treatment) in order to receive the full amount of program assistance, with assistance denied after the third act of noncompliance with the contract. <p>Requires State WORK plans to:  (1) guarantee child care assistance for each TEA family with a needy child requiring such care, to the extent necessary for an individual in the family to participate in job search activities, to work, or to participate in the WORK program; (2) provide for development of programs to reduce the incidence of out-of- wedlock and teen pregnancies; (3) promote family preservation and stability; and (4) develop a quality assurance system for use under the plan along with associated data collection and reporting. <p>Outlines special rules regarding alien eligibility for TEA program assistance. <p>Directs the Secretary to compile data on the effectiveness of the programs under this title for annual reports to the Congress. <p>Provides that upon receiving notice from a State agency administering an approved plan that a named individual has been overpaid under it, the Secretary of the Treasury shall:  (1) determine whether any tax refunds are payable to such individual, regardless of whether he or she filed a return as a married or unmarried individual; and (2) withhold from any such refunds an amount equal to the overpayment sought to be collected, and pay it to the State agency. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations allowing a State to submit requests for collection of overpayments only with respect to individuals no longer receiving TEA assistance against whom the State has already taken appropriate action, including notice of its intent to request such withholding of income tax refunds. <p>Specifies rules for the collection of overpayments under SSA title IV part A. <p><b>Title II:  Work First Employment Block Grant</b> - Replaces the current Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) Training Program under SSA title IV part F with the WORK program of title I, under which States shall have the option of providing a wide variety of work-related activities to clients in the TEA program.  Makes the stated goal of the WORK program the achievement in a cost-effective fashion of full-time unsubsidized paid employment for each adult on TEA assistance. <p>(Sec. 201) Allows States to place in such program clients of TEA assistance pursuant to an approved State plan who have signed a contract described above and absent parents who are unemployed, on the condition that, once employed, such parents meet their child support guidelines, with certain exceptions for clients who are seriously ill or of advanced age. <p>Requires States operating such WORK programs to achieve certain work performance rates over a specified fiscal year period, with reduced Federal payments for States failing twice to achieve the rate required.  Makes use of performance-based bonuses under such program for States achieving their specified fiscal year work performance rate. <p>Provides that each client, who is not exempt from work requirements, shall begin the WORK program by participating for two months in job search activities designed by the State.

Eliminates the maximum 15-day period for such visit and the admission fee of five dollars per vehicle or three dollars per person, depending upon the circumstances, for persons who choose not to purchase the Golden Eagle Passport. Continues the authority of the administering Secretary to establish such fee and to define the period of time for such visit. <p>Repeals provisions prohibiting admission fees to NPS units which provide significant outdoor recreation opportunities in an urban environment and to which access is publicly available at multiple locations. <p>Authorizes the Secretaries to establish procedures for discounted admission fees in lieu of issuing the Golden Age Passport for any citizen of, or person legally domiciled in, the United States who is 62 years of age or older, to be received upon proof of age.  Makes such discount nontransferable.  Applies it only to the individual qualifying based on his or her age and not on the method of travel used by such individual to enter the area. <p>Limits the issuance of lifetime admission permits for NPS units to certain individuals who are medically determined to be permanently disabled (currently, blind or permanently disabled for purposes of receiving Federal benefits as a result of such blindness or disability).  Allows entrance to such designated area to the permittee and one accompanying individual regardless of the method of travel. <p>Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees within six months after enactment of this Act on the entrance fees proposed to be charged at NPS units. <p>Repeals provisions prohibiting admission fees for the following NPS units:  (1) U.S.S. Arizona Memorial; (2) Independence National Historical Park; (3) District of Columbia NPS units; (4) Arlington House-Robert E. Lee National Memorial; (5) San Juan National Historic Site; and (6) Canaveral National Seashore.  Strikes provisions concerning the fee for a single-visit permit applicable to those persons entering Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and Grand Canyon National Park. <p>Allows the charge of a recreation use fee at federally-operated campgrounds without the personal collection of such fee by a Federal employee or agent.  Eliminates the 50 percent discount on such fee for Golden Age Passport permittees.  Provides that comparison of recreation use fees charged by other public and private entities (currently, non-Federal public agencies) should be considered in establishing such fees. <p>Removes the $100 penalty for violation of the Act and imposes such fine as provided by law. <p>Authorizes the National Park Service (Service) to charge a fee for fishing in those park areas under partial (if applicable) or exclusive U.S. jurisdiction where State fishing licenses are not required. <p>Allows the 15 percent authorized to be retained by the Secretaries for fee collection costs to be figured on the collection of the immediately previous fiscal year instead of the current one. <p>Requires:  (1) all additional fee revenue generated by the Service through enactment of this Act beginning in FY 1996 and each fiscal year thereafter, to be covered into a special fund established in the Treasury known as the National Park Renewal Fund; and (2) beginning in FY 1997 and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount of such revenue generated in the immediately preceding fiscal year to be made available to the Secretary, without further provision in appropriations Acts, for park infrastructure needs such as facility refurbishment, repair and replacement, interpretive media and exhibit repair and replacement, and infrastructure projects associated with park resource protection. <p>Requires the Secretary to:  (1) develop procedures for the use of the Fund that ensure accountability and demonstrated results consistent with this Act; and (2) report annually on the expenditures of such receipts on a unit-by-unit basis.  Requires, in FY 1996 only, fees authorized to be collected pursuant to the Act to be collected only to the extent provided in advance in appropriations Acts. <p>Allows amounts covered into the existing special account for the Service that are generated from the collection of admission fees to be used for park operations in NPS units in lieu of resource protection, research, and interpretation purposes. <p>Prohibits the sale of annual admission permits and Golden Eagle Passports by public and private entities under arrangements with collecting agency heads. <p>Allows the total charge (currently, 50 percent) imposed by the Service in lieu of an admission fee when it provides transportation to persons visiting all or a portion of a NPS unit to be retained by such unit for expenditures associated with its transportation system. <p>Requires the Secretary to establish a flat fee that reflects the commercial tour use fee rate and the current admission rates for vehicles entering NPS units where an admission fee is charged. <p>Requires the Secretary to establish reasonable fees for nonrecurring commercial or nonrecreational uses of NPS units that require special arrangements and permits to cover all cost associated with such use except that the Secretary may waive or reduce such fees in the case of any organization using an NPS area for activities which further Service goals.  Allows:  (1) such fees to be retained at the park unit in which the use takes place and to remain available, without further appropriation, to cover the cost of providing such services; and (2) the remaining portion of the fees that exceeds such cost to be deposited into the Fund. <p>Prohibits an admission or recreation use fee of any kind from being charged or imposed for entrance into, or use of, any federally- owned area operated and maintained by a Federal agency and used for outdoor recreation purposes, except as provided for by the Act. <p>(Sec. 3)  Prohibits, as of noon on September 30, 2005, the use of Highway 209 within Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area by commercial vehicles when such use is not connected with the operation of the Area.

Grants anyone who has acknowledged paternity 60 days to rescind such acknowledgement. Allows a court challenge of a signed acknowledgement of paternity after 60 days only on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. <p>Permits a minor who has signed such an acknowledgement outside the presence of a parent or court-appointed guardian ad litem to rescind it beyond the 60-day limit, but no later than the earlier of:  (1) the age of majority; or (2) the date of the first judicial or administrative proceeding brought to establish a support obligation, visitation rights, or custody rights of the child in question at which the minor putative father is represented by a parent, guardian ad litem, or attorney. <p>Requires State procedures under which:  (1) no judicial or administrative proceedings are required or permitted to ratify an unchallenged acknowledgement of paternity; (2) parties to a paternity action are not entitled to a jury trial; and (3) a temporary child support order shall be issued, upon a party's motion, pending an administrative or judicial determination of parentage, where there is clear and convincing evidence of paternity (on the basis of genetic tests or other evidence). <p>(Sec. 342) Requires States to publicize the availability and encourage the use of procedures for voluntary paternity establishment and child support through a variety of means, including:  (1) distribution of written materials at health care facilities and other locations such as schools; (2) pre-natal programs to educate expectant couples on individual and joint rights and responsibilities with respect to paternity; and (3) reasonable follow-up efforts after a new-born child has been discharged from a hospital if paternity or child support have not been established. <p>Sets a Federal matching payment to each State of 90 percent of the costs of outreach programs designed to encourage voluntary acknowledgement of paternity. <p>(Sec. 351) Establishes the National Child Support Guidelines Commission, which shall determine whether it is appropriate to develop a national child support guideline and, if so, develop one. <p>(Sec. 352) Requires States to:  (1) review both AFDC and non-AFDC child support orders every three years at the request of either parent; and (2) adjust an order (without a requirement for any other change in circumstances) if the amount of child support under the order differs from the amount that would be awarded based on State guidelines.  Mandates such a review and adjustment, at either parent's request, at any time there is a substantial change in the circumstances of either such parent. <p>Requires child support orders to require parents to provide each other with annual statements of financial condition. <p>(Sec. 361) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the priorities for child support offset of tax refunds to give first priority to satisfaction of any past-due support which has not been assigned to the State, and only secondarily to satisfaction of past-due support that has been so assigned. <p>Provides that up to $10,000 of any lump-sum child support payment withheld from a tax refund for a family receiving AFDC may be placed in a Qualified Asset Account.  Limits the use of funds in such an account to:  (1) education and training programs; (2) improvements in an individual's employability (including purchase of an automobile); (3) the purchase of a home; or (4) a change of family residence.

Requires the Secretary of State, upon receipt of such a certification, to refuse to issue a passport to such an individual; and permits the Secretary to revoke, restrict, or limit a previously issued passport. <p>(Sec. 381) Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to revise the definition of medical child support order to include such orders issued by an administrative adjudicator and having the force and effect of law under applicable State law. <p>(Sec. 391) Authorizes appropriations for grants to States for programs to support and facilitate absent parents' access and visitation to their children. <p><b>Subtitle B:  Effect of Enactment</b> - Sets forth the effective dates of this title, with provision for specified grace periods for State law changes and State constitutional amendments. <p><b>Title IV:  Supplemental Security Income</b> - Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to issue regulations for determining the disability in individuals under age 18 (disabled children), for supplemental security income (SSI) benefit eligibility purposes, in order to ensure that such eligibility is limited to those individuals whose impairments are so severe as to cause at least:  (1) a marked limitation in at least two domains of functioning or development; or (2) an extreme limitation in at least one such domain. <p>(Sec. 401) Defines ""domain"" as a broad but, to the maximum extent practicable, discrete area of function or development that can be identified in infancy and traced through an individual's maturation. States that under no circumstance may the Commissioner specify a domain of maladaptive behavior or consider the limitations caused by such behavior in more than one domain. <p>Requires the Commissioner, within two years after promulgating such regulations, to redetermine the SSI eligibility of each individual receiving such benefits on the basis of disability found before the effective date of such regulations. <p>(Sec. 402) Amends SSA title XVI (SSI) to direct the Commissioner to establish a directory of services for disabled children that are available within the area served by each Social Security Administration office. <p>(Sec. 403) Requires the Commissioner to use standardized tests measuring childhood development or functioning, or equivalent criteria, when determining whether an individual under age 18 is disabled. <p>(Sec. 404) Sets forth a graduated schedule of benefits for several blind or disabled children living in the same (non-group or non-foster home) household.  Preserves Medicaid eligibility for all such children. <p>(Sec. 405) Requires the representative payee of a disabled child to file a treatment plan for the child, developed by the child's physician or other medical provider, within three months after the child's SSI eligibility determination.  Authorizes the Commissioner to appoint an alternative representative payee, giving preference to the State agency administering the SSI plan, if the original representative payee fails to file a treatment plan. <p>Requires State agencies administering the SSI plan to furnish the Commissioner, upon request, with any information necessary to verify information provided by a representative payee.  Requires the Commissioner to reimburse a State agency for the costs of providing such information. <p>Requires the SSA Inspector General to report to specified congressional committees on the implementation of the treatment plan requirements. <p>(Sec. 406) Requires each representative payee of a disabled child to:  (1) establish an account in a financial institution on behalf of the child; and (2) deposit into it the initial retroactive payment if the amount of such payment equals or exceeds six times the maximum Federal benefit rate.

Limits the use of account funds to education or job skills training or other specified expenses for the disabled child. <p>Requires the Commissioner to establish a system of monitoring payee use of such funds. <p>(Sec. 407) Requires the Commissioner to conduct specified periodic continuing disability reviews for disabled children receiving SSI payments. <p>(Sec. 408) Makes the State agency administering the Maternal and Child Health block grant responsible for developing a care coordination plan for each disabled child.  Directs the Secretary, the Commissioner, and the Secretary of Education to take necessary steps to assure that specified State agencies:  (1) assist in developing such plan; (2) participate in the planning and delivery of services required by the plan; and (3) provide the Secretary for each fiscal year with information on the services provided. <p><b>Title V:  Miscellaneous Provisions</b> - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the tax responsibilities of expatriation. <p>(Sec. 501) Treats all property held immediately before expatriation by a U.S. citizen relinquishing citizenship as sold at such time for its fair market value.  (Excludes from such property: (1) any U.S. real property interest other than stock of a U.S. real property holding corporation; and (2) any interest (not exceeding $500,000) in a qualified retirement plan, foreign or domestic.) Subjects to income taxation any accrued asset gains (in excess of $600,000) as of such date.  Waives such treatment for any individual electing to continue to be taxed as a U.S. citizen. <p>Applies such tax treatment also to certain long-term non-citizen U.S. residents upon losing such resident status. <p>(Sec. 502) Declares that, if a non-resident alien individual becomes a U.S. resident or citizen, gain or loss on the disposition of any property held on the date the individual becomes a resident or citizen shall be determined by substituting, as of the applicable date, the fair market value of such property for its cost basis.  (States that any deduction for depreciation, depletion, or amortization shall be determined without regard to application of this section.) <p>(Sec. 503) Denies the earned income tax credit to:  (1) individuals not authorized to be employed in the United States; and (2) individuals with substantial capital gain net income.  Limits such credit to individuals (including spouses and qualifying children) with social security numbers as tax identification numbers.  Treats taxpayer errors in social security numbers as mathematical or clerical errors (which can be dealt with under certain simplified procedures instead of normal tax deficiency procedures). <p>(Sec. 505)  Revises the treatment of certain stock redemptions as distributions in part or full payment in exchange for the stock. Repeals the current corporate shareholder option to reduce the basis in the remaining stock by the untaxed (deducted) portion of an extraordinary dividend.  Treats any non pro rata redemption (or partial liquidation), with specified exceptions, as a sale of the redeemed stock, even if such distribution would otherwise be treated as a dividend entitled to a dividends received deduction. <p>(Sec. 506) Applies uniform alien eligibility criteria to AFDC, SSI, and Medicaid benefits. <p>(Sec. 507) Repeals the termination date of the five-year deeming requirement under which newly legalized resident aliens are deemed for five years to have the income and assets of their sponsors (thus disqualifying them for SSI benefits for such period of time).  Extends the deeming period for AFDC eligibility from three to five years. Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to extend the deeming period from three to five years for food stamp benefit eligibility.  Exempts from the deeming period (and temporary disqualification for benefits) any alien whose sponsor receives SSI, AFDC, or food stamp benefits. <p>Authorizes the Secretary (and, for food stamps, the Secretary of Agriculture) to alter or suspend application of deeming and disqualification requirements where their application would be inequitable under the circumstances. <p>Authorizes a State or local government to make an alien ineligible for any need-based assistance program it furnishes for any month during which such alien is ineligible for AFDC, SSI, or food stamp benefits.",,,,,,
